<h3>
Building a Culture of Peace in Sierra Leone</h3></center>
<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone
implemented the second phase of their Culture of Peace project, entitled
"PEACE THROUGH EDUCATION", during 2003.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<center>
<h4>
Building on the success</h4></center>
<span class="paragraphStarter">A</span>s of January 2003, the focus of
the "Culture of Peace" program was shifted to include major efforts to
rebuild the primary education system since most of the schools were dismantled
or destroyed and the teachers chased away by the rebels. In addition, peace
building training was expanded to include more training in community organization
so that the communities would become more self sustaining and aware of
their rights and responsibilities and thus better able to fight the root
causes of conflict, poverty, corruption, illiteracy, discrimination and
unemployment. Finally there was a continued effort to alleviate poverty
by supporting community and business ventures that will increase the net
income of the population.&nbsp;
<p><span class="paragraphStarter">E</span>ach Sierra Leone partner developed
projects in the 15 communities where they were working. These projects
were to meet the specific needs of that community as identified and supported
by the members of that community. The end result was to be 15 strong, self
reliant, well organized communities, able to function effectively without
relying on external aid.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<center>
<h4>
Project Summary</h4></center>
