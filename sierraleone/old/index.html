Building a Culture of Peace in Sierra Leone:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Three Sierra Leonean organizations have
joined together to implement a co-ordinated and holistic programme to provide
the base that communities need to build a peaceful society. A group of
Canadian organizations as the Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone, has pledged
to support them in this effort. The Sierra Leonean organizations have identified
three areas of priority for these first three years: Emergency Relief and
Reconstruction, Peace and Development Education, and Micro projects.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Emergency Relief and Reconstruction:</b>
The programme will build on the community animators and their networks
that are already in place to use constructive elements of Sierra Leonean
culture and local materials and skills. Relief and reconstruction activities
can build self-esteem and community coherence as well as dealing with immediate
physical needs such as food and shelter. Reconstruction of schools and
health centres is also planned.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Peace and Development Education:</b>
This component brings members of all sectors of a community together, even
people, especially youth, who were once on opposite sides of a violent
confrontation. Together they develop an understanding of the needs of every
part of the community and plan methods of emergency relief, reconstruction
and disaster preparedness that build reconciliation and a climate of co-operation.
Skills of non-violent conflict resolution, understanding of civil rights
obligations and responsibilities, and fundamentals of good business practice
are part of the experience over the three year period.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Micro Projects</b>: This strategy makes
start-up capital and small project management training available to grassroots
groups and organizations with the intention of improving food security,
and providing employment through small enterprises.</font>
