<b>SIERRA LEONE ON THE MOVE</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from David Hall, Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone.</b><b></b>
<p><b>My overall impression of my first visit to Sierra Leone in July 2002,
was of people on the move, usually on foot, dodging through the crowded
streets of Freetown, striding along the largely deserted highways between
towns and cities, trudging along between villages on dirt tracks barely
wide enough for a small car. There seemed to be constant motion with street
pedlars&nbsp; loaded down with their wares looking for that customer who
will buy and guarantee at least one meal for the day.&nbsp; Women with
small children in tow, leave home to gather firewood and water, consuming
hours of time in search of these basic necessities and carrying them home.
Students walk to school, rain or shine, in small groups according to their
school uniform. They often travel long distances because the school closest
to them is already overcrowded, with as many as 80 students to a class.&nbsp;
There are farmers, men and women both, who enter the city early each morning,
with large baskets on their head, hoping that when they return home the
baskets will be empty and they will have instead a few leones to survive
a few more days. I remember vividly being taken by a woman farmer, deep
into the bush until the pathway disappeared under the water of a flooded
swamp. There she proudly showed me the small area of swamp rice she carefully
tended, using rice seed loaned to get her started again. Then we walked
back to the road and she continued walking back to her home in a nearby
town, along a route she would follow almost daily until the rice was harvested.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Poeple are on the move fighting for survival and peace, but with
a hope and energy that is surprising given the brief period since peace
was officially declared in the January before. Since that time, the people
of Sierra Leone had seen that last of the rebels disarm opr leave for nearby
Liberia,. They had experienced a successful and largely trouble-free national
election which returned President Kabbah with a large majority in parliament.
The talk was of restored jobs in the mining industry and even of future
development of oil offshore.&nbsp; Bu above all people spoke to me of their&nbsp;
absolute commitment to make sure war would not come again to Sierra Leone.</b><b></b>
<p><b>This commitment to peace meant that communities and individuals were
prepared to do what was necessary to ensure peace and the groups we were
working with in Sierra Leone were on the front line organizing and training
for that that peaceful future. I heard personal accounts from peace educators
in Kenema, trained by the Network Movement for Justice and Development
and&nbsp; involved in the reconciliation between communities and families
and returning ex-combattants, some of whom had committed&nbsp; unspeakable
atrocities against their own people.&nbsp; Farmers returning from refugee
camps in Liberia went back to their overgrown fields in Tiama and with
the loan of seed rice from the YMCA and Y Service Club, grew enough rice
to return 95% of the original amount for use by another 80 farmers. At
the same time they produced enough rice&nbsp; for their own seed needs,
for food&nbsp; and even had some to sell at the market. In one northern
community the women joked about how much weight the had put on since starting
their small business and generating enough income for food, using small&nbsp;
loans from the Council of Churches of Sierra Leone.&nbsp; Wherever we went
we met groups and individuals determined to move ahead in their rebuilding,
with or without help from the developed countries.</b><b></b>
<p><b>I was in Sierra Leone with David Bruer, the Executive Director of
Peacefund Canada which serves as the lead agency for a network supporting
the people of Sierra Leone, the Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone. We are
a collection&nbsp; of NGO's, churches and groups based in Ottawa supporting
a Culture of Peace program carried out by our three Sierra Leone Partners.
We had reports to write for major financial supporters and wanted to meet
the people behind the e-mail addresses as well as gather information for
future fund raising and possible program expansion. Meeting the staff and
volunteers of the three organizations just confirmed my impression of people&nbsp;
on the move, crisscrossing the counrty, visiting remore villages, entering
displaced persons camps, bringing the message of reconciliation, peace
building and hope.</b><b></b>
<p><b>In the fifteen chiefdoms and communities where our partners work,
more than 400 trained peace educators are active, settling land and family
disputes, easing the acceptance of returning child soldiers and in the
process, challenging the authority of the chiefs to impose crippling fines,
especially on young people involved in community conflicts. Many people
suggested that these impossible fines drove young people out of their communities,
providing a ready pool of disaffected youth for recruitment by the rebels.&nbsp;
In the Northern Province, women are being targeted by the CCSL for micro-credit
initiatives and training in business practices and financial management.
Then with about $50 CDN as a loan, they can begin to generate income, enough
to feed their families, cover school fees and pay for medical help.&nbsp;
Within a relatively short time, they are able to repay their loans, freeing
up the funds for other women to get started.&nbsp; In the south, NMJD takes
a slightly different approach to income generation, by providing grants
to communities and groups, to build facilities such as storage sheds for
crops or drying floors that will reduce waste and spoilage, leaving more
food for selling in the nearest market.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Throughout our travels, in each community we visited, there was a
"palaver", a community meeting where everyone in the community was able
to say their piece.&nbsp; As representatives of a rich country we were
seated as dignitaries at the "High Table", entertained by dancers and singers,
praised and thanked for all we had contributed. But we also heard from
primary students, village elders, peace educators, women in business and
even a dance theater instructor that the journey towards a lasting peace
was only just beginning. The people were anxious to move further and faster
and pointed out how we could help them in the rebuilding, especially of
civil society.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The peace educators asked for help in spreading their message further
through the use of bicycles and raincoats and suggested the need for Peace
Centres in many villages which could also be used as community meeting
places, for recreation, health clinics and even for primary schooling.
In&nbsp; Makari, the women reminded us that there were 50 other widows
in their community, with no steady source of income and&nbsp; who needed
help to overcome their poverty.&nbsp; In places like Tissoh, I met with
teachers, some unpaid and ill trained, in primary schools where students
had either no furniture or with rudimentary benches and desks since most
had been taken for fuel by the rebels. $30 CDN will cover the cost of primary
education for one child, for a year, including, fees, uniform, books and
supplies. Yet this is a big burden for families who will be fortunate to
earn&nbsp; $100-200 a year and takes away income needed to move beyond
mere survival.</b><b></b>
<p><b>The people of Sierra Leone are not waiting for help from the developed
world, they are moving ahead, albeit slowly and with difficulty. Such perseverance
and resilience deserves our support. Though the war is over and Sierra
Leone has faded from the daily headlines, the effects of almost 10 years
of civil war will take much time and effort to overcome.&nbsp; The Candain
Friends of Sierra Leone, working with our Sierra Leone Partners, is one
vehicle through which Canadians can reach out and show their support and
solidarity.&nbsp; We plan to continue and even expand our efforts to include
rebuilding the primary education system in the 15 communities where we
have a solid base of&nbsp; organized community groups, peace educators
and micro-credit beneficiaries. We have come too far to stop now and our
goal must be to build these communities to a level of strength and self-reliance
that will ensure their success long after the aid agencies have moved on
to the newest world hotspot.</b><b></b>
