		shift to include major efforts to rebuild the primary education system
		since most of the schools were dismantled or destroyed and the teachers
		chased away by the rebels. In addition, peace building training will be
		expanded to include more training in community organization so that the
		communities will become more self sustaining and aware of their rights
		and responsibilities and thus be better able to fight the root causes of
		conflict, poverty, corruption, illiteracy, discrimination and unemployment.
		Finally there will be a continued effort to alleviate poverty by supporting
		community and business ventures that will increase the net income of the
		population.
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">E</span>ach 
		Sierra Leone partner is developing projects in the 15 communities
		where they are working. These projects will meet the specific needs of
		that community as identified and supported by the members of that community.
		The end result will be 15 strong, self reliant, well organized communities,
		able to function effectively without relying on external aid.
