<center><b><font size=+2>BUILDING A CULTURE OF PEACE IN SIERRA LEONE</font></b></center>
<a NAME="oslconnection"></a><b><font size=+1>THE OTTAWA - SIERRA LEONE
CONNECTION</font><font size=+2>.</font></b>
<br><b>A program to link the city of Ottawa with communities in Sierra
Leone in the common cause of peace building and community development.</b>
<p><b>Ottawa City Council has&nbsp; declared the year 2003 as A Year for
Sierra Leone and will encourage the citizens of Ottawa to learn about the
challenges facing the people of Sierra Leone after almost ten years of
civil war and to participate with the people of Sierra Leone in rebuilding
their country.</b>
<p>Under the auspices of Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone, each Ottawa
community would be able to link with a city and district in Sierra Leone,
based on the example of the former city of Nepean being linked with the
city of Bo. Under the direction of&nbsp; the CFSL Planning Committee, representing
various sectors of the community, each area of Ottawa would be encouraged
to establish a Community Action Committee comprising community leaders,
to spearhead the participation of the population. Groups and individuals
would be able to support specific projects in their designated S.L. community
and receive reports and make personal contact with organizers and participants
there.
<p>The partnerships will be as follows:
<p>Ottawa Southwest (Nepean) - Bo city and District - Southern Province
<p>Ottawa West (Kanata) - Kenema city and District - Eastern Province
<p>Ottawa Central (Ottawa, Vanier and Rockcliffe) - Freetown and Western
Area - Western Province
<p>Ottawa East (Gloucester) - Makeni and Bombali District - Northern Province
<p>Ottawa South (West Carleton, Goulborn) - Kono city and District - Eastern
Province
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Within these broad linkages, smaller community groups could establish
links with similar groups in Sierra Leone. The idea is to make the Ottawa-Sierra
Leone Connection a reality at the grass roots level so that Ottawans can
have the option of having a direct link with community partners in Sierra
Leone.
<p>For example:
<p>Schools could partner with schools in Sierra Leone or sponsor the refurbishing
or building of a primary school.
<p>Your church or community group or club can adopt a village to help build
part or all of a a community peace centre or school.
<p><b>What do we want to do?</b>
<p>The year of 2003 will be a time for Ottawans to focus on the needs of
the people of Sierra Leone and to provide much needed help. For example,
CFSL, can identify communities in Sierra Leone where our Sierra Leone partners
have identified the top priorities for action. These Sierra Leone partners,
the Sierra Leone Christian Council of Churches, the YMCA of Sierra Leone
along with the Y Service Club of Freetown and the Network Movement for
Justice and Development, have been laying the groundwork for the past two
years, training Peace Educators and Community Animators in 15 different
communities.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Our goal is to raise an average of $1 per person in Ottawa, approximately
$850 000 to support peace building and community development in several
communities most adversely affected by the civil war. A major new emphasis
for CFSL will be the rebuilding of the primary education system which includes
repairing and rebuilding the schools, replacing the furniture, providing
books and classroom supplies and supporting financially the poorest of
the students. refer to Section B. of this Information Kit for projects
to be funded by Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone.
<p><b>How can you help?</b>
<p>Through CFSL, your group can participate in a particular project and
receive reports and photos of how your donation was used. The project could
be in a a village or town, such as building a drying floor or storage shed,
stocking a health clinic, buying equipment for processing food crops, refurbishing
or even building an orphanage, school or hospital.
<p><b>How far will your donation go?</b> As an individual or group you
can make a difference by giving any amount.
<p>$30 will cover the cost of school for a student for one year including
uniform, books and fees.
<p>$75 will provide a small business loan for a woman or young person to
start their own business. Repayment is usually made within a year so that
someone else can benefit.
<p>$250 will provide a sturdy bicycle for use by a village leader in remote
areas.
<p>$2000 will cover the salary of a community animator for one year
