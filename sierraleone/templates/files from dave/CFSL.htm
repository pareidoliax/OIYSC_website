Leone in early May, 2001. Here is Gianne's report of her impressions of
some of the training programs they visited. An edited version of the <a href="S_L_ webtravelreport.html">trip

<p><b><u>Sierra Leonean Organizations Building a Culture of Peace</u></b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
from Gianne Broughton.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In early May, 2001, Nancy Drozd and I observed culture-building in process
first hand. Using an impressive toolkit of inter-personal communication
skills with flare and art, project workers provoked and cajoled and listened
as people analysed their own experience, began to understand alternatives,
and came to believe that they could build peace. In the first stage, a
group of about 20 men and women learn how to train community peace workers.
We saw the opening day of training at the Council of Churches of Sierra
Leone for people from the Makeni area in the northern region of the country
that was still under rebel control. Three pairs of participants volunteered
to try to push each other to opposite sides of the room: kind of a full-body
arm-wrestling match. Amid laughter and grimaces of effort, participants
observed their own responses too this controlled mini-conflict. Then, the
facilitator lead people in an analysis of their responses and invited discussion
of how they had seen similar responses in the life-and-death conflicts
of their recent history. Everyone present could relate personal stories
of how bloodshed was avoided or stopped. This group had four more days
ahead of them in which they would learn skills in conflict analysis and
resolution, trauma healing, community animation, and, most importantly,
how to teach these skills to others.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In the second stage, which we observed for a group from Freetown at
the YMCA, members from the original group of twenty had gone out and recruited
72 formal and informal community leaders from two neighbouring areas of
the city by talking with people about who they go to for advice and assistance,
or who they know is doing something for the community. These 72 were then
trained by members of the original group using similar techniques and a
curriculum that they had worked out in the first stage.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Finally, in the third stage, these community leaders use their new or
strengthened community animation skills to organise events and activities
to include the whole community so that the conflicts and challenges facing
the community can be discussed openly. We were able to see one such event
organised by project trainees in a rural community near Bo, Semobu Folobu.
With the help of a role-play, members of all segments of the community,
including the civil militia (called "kamajors") who have a traditional
role in Sierra Leone culture, discussed how disarmed rebels could be received
back into the community. This seemed to be the primary challenge to further
progress in the peace process. The rebels would not disarm and disband
while they were certain that they would be retaliated against if they left
the "bush" and returned to a settled life. For me, the role of war-time
atrocities as a strategy for ensuring that a society remains in turmoil,
was unmasked by this discussion. Traditional judicial processes were depicted,
and a traditional libation ceremony and communal meal were also part of
the day's activities. The sense we had of a community ready to face its
future in a common search for peace was celebrated by traditional singing
and dancing at the end of the day.
