<br>The club has several ongoing projects in the community. Our general
approach is to work in partnership with the National Capital Region YMCA/YWCA
and selected community groups, responding to specific requests as we are
able.
<p>a) YMCA-YWCA of&nbsp; the National Capital Region
<br>As a Y Service Club in Ottawa, we offer our support and service primarily
to the National Capital Region YMCA/YWCA and we are available when called
upon. One regular job is the maintenance
<br>of the garden in front of the Y. In 2000 we completed our pledge of
$10,000 over 5 years towards the Building Campaign and we usually provide
additional support for such programs as "Partners for Youth" or for specific
requests&nbsp; from Y staff. During the past years we have moved to increase
our Y involvement with the Y Camp and Y fund raising projects
<p>b) Interval House.
<br>When Interval House started in Ottawa, we were the first service club
to offer our assistance. They know they can come to us if they need financial
or human resources. We help organize and support&nbsp;
<br>the annual&nbsp; Spring Party at the McNabb Community Centre and sometimes
take mothers and&nbsp;
<br>children on outings. We have also held work parties to clean up the
grounds, offered residents a&nbsp;
<br>place to go for a summer break and paid for some children to go to
camp.
<p>c) Habitat for Humanity
<br>Starting in 1999, club members have volunteered in the building of
homes organized by Habitat for Humanity, National Capital Region. Specifically
we do the landscaping work for the homes.
<p>d) Other community groups.
<br>The club responds to requests for help from various groups, especially
those with whom we have worked closely over the years, including the United
Way, Gracefield Camp and Conference Centre.&nbsp;
<p>Projects we consider for support are suggested by our members and we
also encourage and support the community involvement of individual members.</td>
