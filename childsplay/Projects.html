 Tanzania  with Canadian Support of Rural African Initiatives.</p>
   </b> 
<p>They support an AIDS orphanage in Tanzania  run by the NGO, MKUKI, in Tanzania.
Since the early '90's MKUKI has been providing services and support to those
infected and affected by HIV/AIDS in this rural area of Tanzania in the Kilimanjaro
Region. MKUKI has provided many programs for orphans, who have lost parents
to HIV/AIDS. MKUKI works closely with the schools in their area where principals
and teachers identify the orphans in most critical need. Most recently they
have started a school lunch program that provides a nutritious noon meal
for the orphans at these schools. </p>
    
<p>"Through this network of schools we, Mkuki, were able to distribute the 
soccer balls you donated. This is a huge gift for these children who already 
have suffered so much in their young lives. This will bring endless enjoyment 
to so many children who rarely, if ever, see or use a new soccer ball - but 
love the game of soccer!! "  </p>
   
<p>Soccer balls were given to Mkyashi Primary School  and Kilema Primary School.
The combined enrolment at these schools is over 2,000 and they are EXTREMELY
grateful to this equipment as they told me first hand. I had the good fortune
to receive their thanks directly  and I want to pass that gratitude directly
to you and Y Focus Fair Trade Sports. Again, MANY thanks, from CSRAI, MKUKI
and all the students who are benefiting from your donation, warm regards,"</p>

<p>The Kalingalinga Orphanage feeds 500 kids daily many positive for AIDS.. 
 It is run by a Bishop  Anderson.  The  Kanyama Community School, a non-government 
school, has over 300 students with 5 non-paid teachers and about 30% of the 
 children are infected.  Mostly single and double-orphans (1 or both  parents 
died). </p>
   
<p>Training Centre in Livingstone: Fr. Katete Jackosn Jones<font size="2">

<p><font size="2"> </font>We are now partnering with ILO in withdrawing and 
preventing children from involvement in child labour in Livingstone. They 
are targeting 400 children to benefit. 200 will be taken out of child labour 
while 200 will be prevented from going into child labour. Of the 200 to be 
withdrawn, 100 will be trained at our Centre for survival skills such as Carpentry,
Tailoring , Tie &amp; Dye and hair dressing.</p>
   
<p>   </p>
   
<p>  Most of these children are exploited in such things as prostitution (Sex
workers), crushing stones, selling different  things in the streets, domestic
works (servants or baby sitters), charcoal burning, etc. They go into all
jobs so that they pay for schooling  and to buy food because their parents
have died and the guardian cannot afford to provide everything they may need.
Sometimes it is the guardian or single parent that would send   them to work
to make ends meet.</p>
   
<p>   </p>
   
<p>  At our training centre we have a limited capacity to accommodate the 
many children who may need these   skills.   We have negotiated with government 
that the children we shall be sponsoring should be exempted from  school fees
as a contribution from government.</p>
   
<p>   </p>
   
<p>  We believe that in this way, we shall put to an end to the vicious cycle 
of HIV/AIDS and poverty and the children shall be empowered with skills to 
survive and with formal education for their future.</p>

 Swaziland </b>through<b> </b>two New Brunswick AIDS organizations (SIDA/AIDS 
Moncton &amp; AIDS Saint John)</p>
   
<p>They have partnered with The AIDS Information and Support Centre in Swaziland. 
 This small African country has the highest HIV infection rate in the world 
- 42.6%.  The number of orphans continues to rise and is currently at 69,000 
in a population of 1 million.  During our recent visit to Swaziland in April/May 
2005, the Vunca Sincobe Youth Association pointed out their need for soccer 
equipment in order to provide physical activity for the youth in the Village 
of Nkamazi.  </p>
   
<p>Through  Canadian Crossroads International, the two organizations are trying
to address the impact of HIV/AIDS in the rural Swazi community, as well as
helping strengthen the capacity of a local Swazi organization. In the village,
Nkamazi, they are working with the leadership of the Youth Association, and
a group of peer helpers called the 'Sizanani</p>
   
<p>Support Group'.  Their request for help included a request for soccer balls
and shoes for the children of the village. The community is already working
on a project to grow vegetables for orphans in the village, as well as a
potable water project; and  are exploring other ways of helping orphans and
vulnerable children in the community especially using sports such as soccer.</p>
    
<p>Swaziland is named by UNAIDS as the country with the highest rate of HIV 
infection - in the most recent survey 42.6% of pregnant women were HIV positive. 
The number of orphans in our partner village is growing at an astounding rate
- in six months of last year</p>
   
<p>the number of orphans grew from 77 to 110 (among a total population of 
 1800). </p>

<p>DorothyAnn White from Bless the Children, is based in Cambridge, Ont.<b>
 . </b>She visited Malawi, Africa at the end of  January of 2005 and met
with several orphan children that are not only in poverty but have the HIV
virus.</p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<p>"I asked each child what was their favourite thing. Almost every child 
said, football.  They  proceeded  to show me how they enjoy kicking the ball 
to each other.  With the language barrier I said, that's not football but 
it's called soccer.  The interpreter told me in Africa that they call it football."</p>
   
<p> </p>
   
<p>DorothyAnn  left there hoping that she could find a distributor who would 
be interested in helping her take the children soccer balls.  She anticipates 
going back as soon as possble but in the meantime she would like to be able 
to send the children soccer balls.</p>

 Nepal through Childhaven International.</p>
  </b>  
<p>Childhaven International operate an orphanage in Arubari, a small village 
about 8km outside of Kathmandu. The orphanage is run by Nepali staff and volunteers
from all over the world. See www.childhaven.ca for more information.</p>
   
<p>There are over 100 boys and girls who live full-time at the orphanage in
Arubari. They range in age from 1 year to 18 years although the average age
is probably about 8 years old. Not all of the children are orphans but they
are all children who were not consistently receiving at least one meal a
day before they were taken into the home. At the home they receive 3 meals 
a day which consists of mostly rice, curried potatoes, lentils and a few vegetables.
They also have a machine that produces soy milk from soy beans and each child
gets a glass of soy milk twice a day. The home is a modern design and equipped
with electric lights, plumbing and a solar hot water  heater but a low water
table has left the well dry so water must be trucked in a few times a week.
The children sleep on the floor, about 10 to a room that is roughly the size
of an average North American bedroom. </p>

 Lesotho with Help Lesotho.</p>
  </b>  
<p>Help Lesotho is a Canadian initiative partnering public, private and volunteer 
resources, as a response to the increasingly alarming effects of poverty and
HIV/AIDS in Lesotho, Southern Africa. It is fundamentally a partnership between
various interests in Canada and Lesotho. </p>
   
<p align="Justify">There are now over 6,000 Basotho (the name of the people 
of Lesotho) children benefiting from our projects. There are thousands of 
Canadian students writing to their pen pals in English, their second language. 
In Canada, hundreds are involved in various ways. Funds are raised by children 
for children. Schools, churches, and individuals have come forward with real 
compassion to form relationships with our Basotho friends. Many have volunteered 
to work in Lesotho on specific projects for 1-6 months. In Lesotho, there 
are over 20 projects underway, with more in the final planning stages. </p>
   
<p align="Justify"></p>
   
<p align="Justify">Help Lesotho was founded in 2004 to provide hope and support 
to the children of this small mountain kingdom entirely surrounded by South 
Africa. One of the poorest countries in the world, Lesotho has the 3rd highest 
rate of HIV/AIDS on earth. Over 30% of children are orphaned and life expectancy 
is rapidly falling to 31 years. Over 60% of the population is under 24 years 
of age. With a rapidly decreasing population of 2.1 million and a landmass 
of 30,500 sq. km, it is an unusually homogeneous population of 99.7% Basotho 
people, of whom 80% are Christian. It therefore does not have the racial and
ethnic conflicts that draw media attention. It is a forgotten country.<br>
  Called Roof of Africa by virtue of being the third highest country in the 
world, Lesotho is a small, mountainous and deforested country, with almost 
no natural resources. Well into its 5th year of debilitating drought, there 
is also a crucial water and food shortage. Soil erosion is expected to deplete 
arable land by 2040. An unemployment rate reaching 50-60% and an alarming 
degree of crime and stock theft are producing an unprecedented state of poverty.

school where 5 of the children were studying (Busabaga Primary School) and 
in 1996, school supplies were donated to the same school</p>
   
<p>In 1998, a water tank was installed and sanitary facilities constructed 
to help the school and community at large. In 2002 – books were sent by NJ 
Links for the children  and in 2003 – Soccer (foot ball) shirts were donated 
to St Judy Primary School Kakooge Luweero by St Augustine Elementary School 
with the help of Ottawa Sports Club.</p>
   
<p>In 2003, CanHave received a donation of $ 6000 to construct a library and
study books and the next year the library was completed and dedicated (Outspan
Primary School)</p>
   
<p>During 2004 and 2005, school supplies were donated by Greater Gatineau 
Elementary School and distributed to the children in our program and 3 other 
schools ( Busabaga, St Judy and Outspan primary schools) and 700 pairs of 
socks were also donated by Greater Gatineau Elementary School</p>
   
<p>Recently a van was donated to Canhave for the use of the Volunteer Field 
Worker/Children and a water tank was donated to Outspan Primary School by 
Greater Gatineau Elementary School.</p>
