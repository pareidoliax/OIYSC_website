<P>In Ottawa, we are inviting individuals and groups to do something tangible by collecting and donating used soccer balls and equipment, as well as cash,  through a program called &quot;Let the Children Play&quot; sponsored by the Ottawa Y Service club, Y FOCUS. We are passing on all donations to 10 Canadian based organizations who work with children in 15 different countries. Some of these agencies are based in the Ottawa area with projects such as a vocational training program for orphans in Uganda, an orphanage in Nepal, a youth run bakery in El Salvador and an SOS Children’s Village in Brazil. The full list of agencies and projects is available on our web site at <A HREF="http://www.ncf.ca/yfocus/childsplay">www.ncf.ca/yfocus/childsplay</A> </P>
