<p>SOS Children’s Villages in Brazil</p>
 </font></b><font face="Arial" size="3">
<p>With the aim of providing support to the poorer members of society, SOS
Children's Villages started working in Brazil in the late 1960s, opening
three SOS Children's Villages in Brasilia, Porto Alegre and Poà near Sao
Paulo in 1970. The villages were able to provide new homes and security children
whose parents could no longer support them during the difficult economic
situation at the time. Since then a further eleven SOS Children's Villages
have been built, in addition to thirteen SOS Youth facilities, twelve SOS
Social Centres and four SOS Hermann-Gmeiner Schools in order to provide the
education and skills necessary for a brighter future.</p>

<p>The '6 villages for 2006' Village</p>
 </font></b><font face="Arial" size="3">
<p>Brazil is home to vast numbers of the population living on or below the
poverty line. A large percentage of these poor are concentrated in the North
East of the country, where social provisions are scarce. The coastal town
of Recife, in the North Eastern province of Pernambuco, has therefore been
chosen as one of the FIFA/SOS "6 villages for 2006". The  campaign, a joint
project between world football's governing body, FIFA, and SOS Children's
Villages will run until the end of the 2006 FIFA World Cup and aims to raise
funds for six new SOS Children's Villages in order to provide more disadvantaged
children with a new home and hope for the future</p>
 </font><font face="Arial" size="2"> </font><font face="Arial" size="3">
<p>Recife is a large town, which has grown quickly and without careful planning,
leading to the concentration of social problems in the area. It has a population
of almost 1.5 million, of which a quarter is under the age of 15 and a third
is living on less than half of the minimum salary (Foundation Getulio Vargas).
School attendance rates are particularly alarming, with 280,000 people, or
20% of the population, having less than one year's schooling and over 200,000
people have only completed up to three years of education. Almost 10% of
the town's population is estimated to be unemployed, with the informal sector
providing employment for substantial proportion of the population. </p>
  
<p>A recent UNESCO map of violence identified Pernambuco as being amongst
the worst states for youth violence in Brazil, with Recife having the second
highest murder rate of young people and worrying statistics relating to drugs
and sexual exploitation. Over 300 children and young people in the area are
believed to be in need of long term support and assistance, but for whom,
because of their age, ethnic background or other reason, adoption is highly
unlikely. Official social provisions for these children and youths are increasingly
inappropriate with numbers of places constantly reduced, often resulting
in their relocation to institutions in neighbouring cities away from their
family and friends. Such social, economic and political factors have therefore
convinced the local authorities of the need for an SOS Children's Village
in the area. </p>
  
<p>A 30,000m² area of land in the Igarassu district, 26km from the centre
of Recife, is to be donated by the State of Pernambuco. Construction of the
twelve new family houses, ancillary buildings and sports ground will commence
in April 2005, and should be completed for the arrival of the 108 intended
children by December 2006. The facilities will also include a kindergarten,
with 2 classes, and a social centre offering medical and dental assistance
as well as counselling and psychological support. The proposed site is ideally
positioned for local amenities, with large shopping centres and markets,
banks, schools, health centres and a number of other businesses nearby as
well as good public transport links. </p>

<p>A snapshot of the country.</p>

<p><font size="3"><img src="Image21.jpg" width="307" height="283">
</font><font face="Arial" size="3">Covering an area of more than 8.5 million
km², Brazil is the fifth largest country in the world and by far the largest
country in South America. It is home to a wealth of natural resources and
some of the world's most diverse flora and fauna, including the Amazon rainforest,
which contains 30% of the world's remaining forest (Lonely Planet, 2004).
The country also ranks among the world's top ten economies, its Gross Domestic
Product exceeding USD 1.379 trillion<i> </i>(CIA Factbook 2004). However,
with a population of over 176 million, a quarter of which currently lives
on USD 1 a day (DFID 2004), Brazil's vast wealth is among the most unevenly
distributed in the world.</font></p>
  
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">The only South American nation to have been
under the rule of the Portuguese, Brazil gained independence in 1822, following
which the country has seen a number of military interventions in the government,
resulting in a largely authoritarian rule before a new, more democratic constitution
was introduced in 1988. Despite enjoying periods of rapid economic growth,
and the development of large and profitable agricultural, mining, manufacturing
and service sectors, the country has suffered from years of corruption and
economic neglect. </font></p>
  
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Due to the country's rapidly increasing population
growth and the significant rural migration, Brazil is home to some of the
largest cities in the world, with roughly 80% of the country's population
living in urban areas (USAID 2004). Unemployment in urban areas is estimated
to be as high as 25%, almost double the national average (USAID 2004), and
consequently poverty in the towns and cities is considerable. Brazil's cities
are indeed famous for their sprawling shanty towns, or favelas, which are
often found in areas considered unsuitable for habitation due to adverse
geographical conditions and lack of resources and public services, but where
the country's poor are forced to seek refuge. </font></p>
  
<p><font face="Arial" size="3">Because of the extreme poverty in urban areas,
many children and youths are forced to work or beg for a living rather than
attend school. Some children, whose families can no longer support them,
find themselves living on the streets exposed to drugs and crime and even
physical and sexual abuse.</font></p>
