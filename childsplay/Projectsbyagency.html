<p>ACCESO International supports a homework centre in Verettes and a primary 
school in Gona&iuml;ves. The homework centre in Verettes offers literacy support
for at-risk, impoverished and orphaned children. Activities include tutoring
sessions, basic literacy and pre-school classes, as well as summer camps.
The intention is to enable these children to grow as persons who are free,
responsible, builders of peace and committed to changing their world so that
they will be able to actively shape their own lives and to experience all
the rights to which they are entitled. At the primary school in Gona&iuml;ves,
ACCESO International is providing educational supplies and a much needed
meal program for over 700 children who attend daily classes in three different
shifts. ACCESO International is assisting this school in its efforts to rebuild
after it was severely damaged by a hurricane in 2004. </p>
<p><a href="Honduras.htm"><b>HONDURAS</b></a>

<p>ACCESO International provides educational materials and bursary assistance 
for an orphanage in La Flecha, an orphanage in El Progreso, a primary school 
in the remote mountain village of Buen Ejemplo and a home work centre in Los
Laureles. Through these four projects, over 400 primary level children are
being individually </p>
<p>assisted with shoes, packsacks, uniforms and nutrition, while their classrooms
have become more colourful, creative and stimulating with many much needed
school supplies. ACCESO International also helps a high school in El Progreso
and a high school in La Lima whereby 3 young women are receiving full bursaries
to attend these institutions and the classrooms and libraries of over 1500
high school students are being </p>
<p>filled with supplies and books. <br>

<p>Their projects include: </p>
<p>The maintenance of 25 children through taking care of all their basic needs.
School fees and other expenses were paid for 10 students who successfully 
completed high school. In 1995, 25 windows and 1 door were installed in a
school where 5 of the children were studying (Busabaga Primary School) and
in 1996, school supplies were donated to the same school </p>
<p>In 1998, a water tank was installed and sanitary facilities constructed 
to help the school and community at large. In 2002 &#8211; books were sent by NJ
Links for the children and in 2003 &#8211; Soccer (foot ball) shirts were donated
to St Judy Primary School Kakooge Luweero by St Augustine Elementary School
with the help of Ottawa Sports Club. </p>
<p>In 2003, CanHave received a donation of $ 6000 to construct a library and
study books and the next year the library was completed and dedicated (Outspan
Primary School) </p>
<p>During 2004 and 2005, school supplies were donated by Greater Gatineau 
Elementary School and distributed to the children in our program and 3 other
schools ( Busabaga, St Judy and Outspan primary schools) and 700 pairs of
socks were also donated by Greater Gatineau Elementary School </p>
<p>Recently a van was donated to Canhave for the use of the Volunteer Field 
Worker/Children and a water tank was donated to Outspan Primary School by
Greater Gatineau Elementary School. </p>
<p>The latest project is to build a Trade school and 10 more children have 
been added to the list of recipients. <br>

<p>CSRAI&nbsp; supports an AIDS orphanage run by the NGO, MKUKI, in Tanzania. 
Since the early '90's MKUKI has been providing services and support to those
infected and affected by HIV/AIDS in this rural area of Tanzania in the Kilimanjaro
Region. MKUKI has provided many programs for orphans, who have lost parents
to HIV/AIDS. MKUKI works closely with the schools in their area where principals
and teachers identify the orphans in most critical need. Most recently they
have started a school lunch program that provides a nutritious noon meal
for the orphans at these schools. </p>
<p>"Through this network of schools we, Mkuki, were able to distribute the
soccer balls you donated. This is a huge gift for these children who already
have suffered so much in their young lives. This will bring endless enjoyment
to so many children who rarely, if ever, see or use a new soccer ball - but
love the game of soccer!! " </p>
<p>Soccer balls were given to Mkyashi Primary School and Kilema Primary School.
The combined enrolment at these schools is over 2,000 and they are EXTREMELY
grateful to this equipment as they told me first hand. I had the good fortune
to receive their thanks directly and I want to pass that gratitude directly
to you and Y Focus Fair Trade Sports. Again, MANY thanks, from CSRAI, MKUKI
and all the students who are benefiting from your donation, warm regards,"

<p>Childhaven International operate an orphanage in Arubari, a small village 
about 8km outside of Kathmandu. The orphanage is run by Nepali staff and volunteers
from all over the world. See www.childhaven.ca for more information. </p>
<p>There are over 100 boys and girls who live full-time at the orphanage in
Arubari. They range in age from 1 year to 18 years although the average age
is probably about 8 years old. Not all of the children are orphans but they
are all children who were not consistently receiving at least one meal a
day before they were taken into the home. At the home they receive 3 meals
a day which consists of mostly rice, curried potatoes, lentils and a few
vegetables. They also have a machine that produces soy milk from soy beans
and each child gets a glass of soy milk twice a day. The home is a modern
design and equipped with electric lights, plumbing and a solar hot water
heater but a low water table has left the well dry so water must be trucked
in a few times a week. The children sleep on the floor, about 10 to a room
that is roughly the size of an average North American bedroom. <br>

<b>PROJECT HELP LESOTHO</b> </p>
<p><a href="Lesotho.htm"><b>LESOTHO</b></a>
 </p>
<p>Help Lesotho is a Canadian initiative partnering public, private and volunteer
resources, as a response to the increasingly alarming effects of poverty
and HIV/AIDS in Lesotho, Southern Africa. </p>
<p>Project Help Lesotho was created in 2004 by an Ottawa resident, Dr. Peg
Herbert. Peg was inspired by a friend of hers from Lesotho who was studying
at Ottawa University. Lesotho is a small, land locked country that is completely
surrounded by South Africa. The people are very poor and the country is being
devastated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Project Help Lesotho has spear headed
many programs to help the Basotho children in the following ways: the building
and supporting of boarding schools for young orphan girls, the twinning of
Canadian and Besotho schools to promote friendship, give financial support
to the schools in Lesotho and to help purchase school uniforms for the children.
There are also some economic projects that support local women making bead
broaches, canvas bags and hats. There have been leadership camps for the
Besotho school children as well as leadership awards given to worthy recipients.
Canadians are given the opportunity to sponsor orphans, ensuring they have
a school uniform and that their fees are paid so they can attend school. </p>
<p>There are now over 6,000 Basotho (the name of the people of Lesotho) children
benefiting from our projects. There are thousands of Canadian students writing
to their pen pals in English, their second language. In Canada, hundreds
are involved in various ways. Funds are raised by children for children.
Schools, churches, and individuals have come forward with real compassion
to form relationships with our Basotho friends. Many have volunteered to
work in Lesotho on specific projects for 1-6 months. In Lesotho, there are
over 20 projects underway, with more in the final planning stages. </p>
<p>One of the poorest countries in the world, Lesotho has the 3rd highest 
rate of HIV/AIDS on earth. Over 30% of children are orphaned and life expectancy 
is rapidly falling to 31 years. Over 60% of the population is under 24 years
of age. With a rapidly decreasing population of 2.1 million and a landmass
of 30,500 sq. km, it is an unusually homogeneous population of 99.7% Basotho
people, of whom 80% are Christian. It therefore does not have the racial
and ethnic conflicts that draw media attention. <br>
Called Roof of Africa by virtue of being the third highest country in the
world, Lesotho is a small, mountainous and deforested country, with almost
no natural resources. Well into its 5th year of debilitating drought, there
is also a crucial water and food shortage. Soil erosion is expected to deplete
arable land by 2040. An unemployment rate reaching 50-60% and an alarming
degree of crime and stock theft are producing an unprecedented state of poverty.

organization composed of a network of communities and supporters that stretches
from coast to coast. </p>
<p>SALV AIDE'S GOALS ARE: </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; To increase the strength of civil society in El Salvador as represented
by non- governmental </p>
<p>&nbsp;organizations (NGOs), popular organizations, women's organizations 
and communities. </p>
<p>2.&nbsp; To strengthen local economies in El Salvador which are participating 
in regional and national </p>
<p>efforts to create sustainable and diversified economic development. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp; To build Canadian support for community and democratic development 
in El Salvador. </p>
<p>&nbsp;SALVAIDE&nbsp; activities: </p>
<p>SalvAide funds development projects in El Salvador designed by rural communities
to meet their needs and priorities. Since 1985 SalvAide has funded such diverse
projects as poultry farms, dairy herds, daycares, schools, community stores,
medical clinics, cottage industries and legal aid clinics. SalvAide also
funds human rights work and organizational development of Salvadorean non-governmental
and popular organizations. <br>

<p>The Kalingalinga Orphanage feeds 500 kids daily many positive for AIDS.. 
It is run by a Bishop Anderson. The Kanyama Community School, a non-government 
school, has over 300 students with 5 non-paid teachers and about 30% of the
children are infected. Mostly single and double-orphans (1 or both parents
died). </p>
<p>Training Centre in Livingstone: Fr. Katete Jackosn Jones<font size="-1">
 .</font> </p>
<p>We are now partnering with ILO in withdrawing and preventing children from
involvement in child labour in Livingstone. They are targeting 400 children
to benefit. 200 will be taken out of child labour while 200 will be prevented
from going into child labour. Of the 200 to be withdrawn, 100 will be trained
at our Centre for survival skills such as Carpentry, Tailoring , Tie &amp;
Dye and hair dressing. </p>
<p>Most of these children are exploited in such things as prostitution (Sex
workers), crushing stones, selling different things in the streets, domestic
works (servants or baby sitters), charcoal burning, etc. They go into all
jobs so that they pay for schooling and to buy food because their parents
have died and the guardian cannot afford to provide everything they may need.
Sometimes it is the guardian or single parent that would send them to work
to make ends meet. </p>
<p>At our training centre we have a limited capacity to accommodate the many
children who may need these skills. We have negotiated with government that
the children we shall be sponsoring should be exempted from school fees as
a contribution from government. </p>
<p>We believe that in this way, we shall put to an end to the vicious cycle 
of HIV/AIDS and poverty and the children shall be empowered with skills to
survive and with formal education for their future. <br>

 </p>
<p>They have partnered with The AIDS Information and Support Centre in Swaziland.
This small African country has the highest HIV infection rate in the world
- 42.6%. The number of orphans continues to rise and is currently at 69,000
in a population of 1 million. During our recent visit to Swaziland in April/May
2005, the Vunca Sincobe Youth Association pointed out their need for soccer
equipment in order to provide physical activity for the youth in the Village
of Nkamazi. </p>
<p>Through Canadian Crossroads International, the two organizations are trying
to address the impact of HIV/AIDS in the rural Swazi community, as well as
helping strengthen the capacity of a local Swazi organization. In the village,
Nkamazi, they are working with the leadership of the Youth Association, and
a group of peer helpers called the 'Sizanani </p>
<p>Support Group'. Their request for help included a request for soccer balls
and shoes for the children of the village. The community is already working
on a project to grow vegetables for orphans in the village, as well as a
potable water project; and are exploring other ways of helping orphans and
vulnerable children in the community especially using sports such as soccer. 
</p>
<p>Swaziland is named by UNAIDS as the country with the highest rate of HIV
infection - in the most recent survey 42.6% of pregnant women were HIV positive.
The number of orphans in our partner village is growing at an astounding
rate - in six months of last year </p>
<p>the number of orphans grew from 77 to 110 (among a total population of
1800). <br>

<b>SOS Children&#8217;s Villages Canada.</b> </p>

 </p>
<p>SOS Children's Villages has been in existence for more than 50 years and
has become active in 131 countries. Girls and boys find a new home in more
than 440 SOS Children's Villages - children who have lost their parents through
war, disease or natural disaster, who have been forced out of their homes
or who can no longer live with their parents. </p>
<p>SOS Children&#8217;s Villages in Brazil <br>
With the aim of providing support to the poorer members of society, SOS Children's
Villages started working in Brazil in the late 1960s, opening three SOS Children's
Villages in Brasilia, Porto Alegre and Po&agrave; near Sao Paulo in 1970.
The villages were able to provide new homes and security children whose parents
could no longer support them during the difficult economic situation at the
time. Since then a further eleven SOS Children's Villages have been built,
in addition to thirteen SOS Youth facilities, twelve SOS Social Centres and
four SOS Hermann-Gmeiner Schools in order to provide the education and skills
necessary for a brighter future. </p>
<p>Recife is a large town, which has grown quickly and without careful planning,
leading to the concentration of social problems in the area. It has a population
of almost 1.5 million, of which a quarter is under the age of 15 and a third
is living on less than half of the minimum salary (Foundation Getulio Vargas).
School attendance rates are particularly alarming, with 280,000 people, or
20% of the population, having less than one year's schooling and over 200,000
people have only completed up to three years of education. Almost 10% of
the town's population is estimated to be unemployed, with the informal sector
providing employment for substantial proportion of the population. </p>
<p>A recent UNESCO map of violence identified Pernambuco as being amongst 
the worst states for youth violence in Brazil, with Recife having the second 
highest murder rate of young people and worrying statistics relating to drugs
and sexual exploitation. Over 300 children and young people in the area are
believed to be in need of long term support and assistance, but for whom,
because of their age, ethnic background or other reason, adoption is highly
unlikely. Official social provisions for these children and youths are increasingly
inappropriate with numbers of places constantly reduced, often resulting
in their relocation to institutions in neighbouring cities away from their
family and friends. Such social, economic and political factors have therefore
convinced the local authorities of the need for an SOS Children's Village
in the area. <br>

<p>The Freetown Y Service club with the support of Y FOCUS is implementing 
a training program for unemployed young adults, where they learn about indigenous
products they can make and receive basic business training so that they can
form co-operatives to provide them with jobs and incomes. 56 young people
in 8 communities are being trained during the first year of the program and
will be helped to set up their own business usually as a co-operative in
groups of 4-5 youth. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;There is also an orphanage called Jonathan&#8217;s House supported by the
Y Service club and the YMCA in Freetown. The home is committed to finding 
kids on the streets and providing food, clothing, shelter, education and medical&nbsp;
treatment.&nbsp; The children&#8217;s fees and uniforms for school are paid for
and the YMCA in&nbsp; Freetown provides administrative support and oversight.
There are 62 children in the program, boys and girls of all ages with a budget
of $35 000 per year. <br>

 </p>
<p>In a poor township, there are many grandmothers now left with grandchildren 
to look after since their parents have died. <br>
The Wakefield Grannies.&nbsp; The Wakefield Grannies are a group of women
offering support to AIDs Orphans and their Grandmothers in Alexandra Township,
South Africa by providing direct financial assistance to the Tara Hospital
Children's Clinic, and by keeping a correspondence with the individual women
who attend the clinic&#8217;s program. </p>
<p><b>The Background</b> <br>
On a visit to Quebec in 2004, Rose Letwaba spoke about her work to a small
audience in the Wakefield United Church.&nbsp; Rose is a nurse in the health
clinic in Alexandra Township on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa.&nbsp;
The picture she painted was of a whole generation of South Africans lost
to AIDs and grieving mothers left to carry the burden of raising their grandchildren
to be healthy, educated and socially responsible adults.&nbsp; Rose described
a group of 40 such Grannies who were meeting at her clinic for sewing classes,
gardening and moral support. </p>
<p>Spontaneously, 12 Wakefield women, lead by Norma Geggie (81) came together 
to help, becoming the first Grannies to link with the Alexandra Grannies or
GoGos to use the South African word. </p>
<p><b>Today</b> <br>
The Wakefield Grannies are committed to providing financial assistance to
their counterparts in Alexandra. To do this they produce fundraising events. 
<br>
Each Wakefield Granny also has an individual GoGo to whom they write letters.&nbsp;
It may seem that raising money is the most important aspect of their activities.&nbsp;
In fact, Rose Letwaba wrote after some South African GoGos received letters
from Canada that &#8220;Morale is high in these groups and there is a lot of hope,
just the idea and the thought that there are Grannies on the other side of
the world who care so much about them, make these groups appreciate life&#8230;&#8221;
