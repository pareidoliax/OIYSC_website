Tanzania with Canadian Support of Rural African Initiatives.</p>
 </b>
<p>They support an AIDS orphanage in Tanzania run by the NGO, MKUKI, in Tanzania.
Since the early '90's MKUKI has been providing services and support to those
infected and affected by HIV/AIDS in this rural area of Tanzania in the Kilimanjaro
Region. MKUKI has provided many programs for orphans, who have lost parents
to HIV/AIDS. MKUKI works closely with the schools in their area where principals
and teachers identify the orphans in most critical need. Most recently they
have started a school lunch program that provides a nutritious noon meal
for the orphans at these schools. </p>
 
<p>"Through this network of schools we, Mkuki, were able to distribute the
soccer balls you donated. This is a huge gift for these children who already
have suffered so much in their young lives. This will bring endless enjoyment
to so many children who rarely, if ever, see or use a new soccer ball - but
love the game of soccer!! " </p>
 
<p>Soccer balls were given to Mkyashi Primary School and Kilema Primary School.
The combined enrolment at these schools is over 2,000 and they are EXTREMELY
grateful to this equipment as they told me first hand. I had the good fortune
to receive their thanks directly and I want to pass that gratitude directly
to you and Y Focus Fair Trade Sports. Again, MANY thanks, from CSRAI, MKUKI
and all the students who are benefiting from your donation, warm regards,"</p>

<p>The Kalingalinga Orphanage feeds 500 kids daily many positive for AIDS..
It is run by a Bishop Anderson. The Kanyama Community School, a non-government
school, has over 300 students with 5 non-paid teachers and about 30% of the
children are infected. Mostly single and double-orphans (1 or both parents
died). </p>
 
<p>Training Centre in Livingstone: Fr. Katete Jackosn Jones<font size="2">
 . </font></p>
 
<p>We are now partnering with ILO in withdrawing and preventing children
from involvement in child labour in Livingstone. They are targeting 400 children
to benefit. 200 will be taken out of child labour while 200 will be prevented
from going into child labour. Of the 200 to be withdrawn, 100 will be trained
at our Centre for survival skills such as Carpentry, Tailoring , Tie &amp;
Dye and hair dressing.</p>
 
<p>Most of these children are exploited in such things as prostitution (Sex
workers), crushing stones, selling different things in the streets, domestic
works (servants or baby sitters), charcoal burning, etc. They go into all
jobs so that they pay for schooling and to buy food because their parents
have died and the guardian cannot afford to provide everything they may need.
Sometimes it is the guardian or single parent that would send them to work
to make ends meet.</p>
 
<p>At our training centre we have a limited capacity to accommodate the many
children who may need these skills. We have negotiated with government that
the children we shall be sponsoring should be exempted from school fees as
a contribution from government.</p>
 
<p>We believe that in this way, we shall put to an end to the vicious cycle
of HIV/AIDS and poverty and the children shall be empowered with skills to
survive and with formal education for their future.</p>

<p><b><a name="Swaziland"></a>
Swaziland </b>through<b> </b>two New Brunswick AIDS organizations (SIDA/AIDS
Moncton &amp; AIDS Saint John)</p>
 
<p>They have partnered with The AIDS Information and Support Centre in Swaziland.
This small African country has the highest HIV infection rate in the world
- 42.6%. The number of orphans continues to rise and is currently at 69,000
in a population of 1 million. During our recent visit to Swaziland in April/May
2005, the Vunca Sincobe Youth Association pointed out their need for soccer
equipment in order to provide physical activity for the youth in the Village
of Nkamazi. </p>
 
<p>Through Canadian Crossroads International, the two organizations are trying
to address the impact of HIV/AIDS in the rural Swazi community, as well as
helping strengthen the capacity of a local Swazi organization. In the village,
Nkamazi, they are working with the leadership of the Youth Association, and
a group of peer helpers called the 'Sizanani</p>
 
<p>Support Group'. Their request for help included a request for soccer balls
and shoes for the children of the village. The community is already working
on a project to grow vegetables for orphans in the village, as well as a
potable water project; and are exploring other ways of helping orphans and
vulnerable children in the community especially using sports such as soccer.</p>
 
<p>Swaziland is named by UNAIDS as the country with the highest rate of HIV
infection - in the most recent survey 42.6% of pregnant women were HIV positive.
The number of orphans in our partner village is growing at an astounding
rate - in six months of last year the number of orphans grew from 77 to 110
(among a total population of 1800). </p>

<p>DorothyAnn White from Bless the Children, is based in Cambridge, Ont.<b>
 . </b>She visited Malawi, Africa at the end of January of 2005 and met with
several orphan children that are not only in poverty but have the HIV virus.</p>
 
<p>"I asked each child what was their favourite thing. Almost every child
said, football. They proceeded to show me how they enjoy kicking the ball
to each other. With the language barrier I said, that's not football but
it's called soccer. The interpreter told me in Africa that they call it football."</p>
 
<p>DorothyAnn left there hoping that she could find a distributor who would
be interested in helping her take the children soccer balls. She anticipates
going back as soon as possble but in the meantime she would like to be able
to send the children soccer balls.</p>

Nepal through Childhaven International.</p>
 </b>
<p>Childhaven International operate an orphanage in Arubari, a small village
about 8km outside of Kathmandu. The orphanage is run by Nepali staff and
volunteers from all over the world. See www.childhaven.ca for more information.</p>
 
<p>There are over 100 boys and girls who live full-time at the orphanage
in Arubari. They range in age from 1 year to 18 years although the average
age is probably about 8 years old. Not all of the children are orphans but
they are all children who were not consistently receiving at least one meal
a day before they were taken into the home. At the home they receive 3 meals
a day which consists of mostly rice, curried potatoes, lentils and a few
vegetables. They also have a machine that produces soy milk from soy beans
and each child gets a glass of soy milk twice a day. The home is a modern
design and equipped with electric lights, plumbing and a solar hot water
heater but a low water table has left the well dry so water must be trucked
in a few times a week. The children sleep on the floor, about 10 to a room
that is roughly the size of an average North American bedroom. </p>

<p><a name="Lesotho"></a>
Lesotho with Help Lesotho.</p>
 </b>
<p>Help Lesotho is a Canadian initiative partnering public, private and volunteer
resources, as a response to the increasingly alarming effects of poverty
and HIV/AIDS in Lesotho, Southern Africa. It is fundamentally a partnership
between various interests in Canada and Lesotho. </p>
 
<p align="Justify">There are now over 6,000 Basotho (the name of the people
of Lesotho) children benefiting from our projects. There are thousands of
Canadian students writing to their pen pals in English, their second language.
In Canada, hundreds are involved in various ways. Funds are raised by children
for children. Schools, churches, and individuals have come forward with real
compassion to form relationships with our Basotho friends. Many have volunteered
to work in Lesotho on specific projects for 1-6 months. In Lesotho, there
are over 20 projects underway, with more in the final planning stages. </p>
 
<p align="Justify">Help Lesotho was founded in 2004 to provide hope and support
to the children of this small mountain kingdom entirely surrounded by South
Africa. One of the poorest countries in the world, Lesotho has the 3rd highest
rate of HIV/AIDS on earth. Over 30% of children are orphaned and life expectancy
is rapidly falling to 31 years. Over 60% of the population is under 24 years
of age. With a rapidly decreasing population of 2.1 million and a landmass
of 30,500 sq. km, it is an unusually homogeneous population of 99.7% Basotho
people, of whom 80% are Christian. It therefore does not have the racial
and ethnic conflicts that draw media attention. <br>
 Called Roof of Africa by virtue of being the third highest country in the
world, Lesotho is a small, mountainous and deforested country, with almost
no natural resources. Well into its 5th year of debilitating drought, there
is also a crucial water and food shortage. Soil erosion is expected to deplete
arable land by 2040. An unemployment rate reaching 50-60% and an alarming
degree of crime and stock theft are producing an unprecedented state of poverty.

<p>Their projects include:</p>
 
<p>The maintenance of 25 children through taking care of all their basic
needs. School fees and other expenses were paid for 10 students who successfully
completed high school. In 1995, 25 windows and 1 door were installed in a
school where 5 of the children were studying (Busabaga Primary School) and
in 1996, school supplies were donated to the same school</p>
 
<p>In 1998, a water tank was installed and sanitary facilities constructed
to help the school and community at large. In 2002 – books were sent by NJ
Links for the children and in 2003 – Soccer (foot ball) shirts were donated
to St Judy Primary School Kakooge Luweero by St Augustine Elementary School
with the help of Ottawa Sports Club.</p>
 
<p>In 2003, CanHave received a donation of $ 6000 to construct a library
and study books and the next year the library was completed and dedicated
(Outspan Primary School)</p>
 
<p>During 2004 and 2005, school supplies were donated by Greater Gatineau
Elementary School and distributed to the children in our program and 3 other
schools ( Busabaga, St Judy and Outspan primary schools) and 700 pairs of
socks were also donated by Greater Gatineau Elementary School</p>
 
<p>Recently a van was donated to Canhave for the use of the Volunteer Field
Worker/Children and a water tank was donated to Outspan Primary School by
Greater Gatineau Elementary School.</p>
 
<p>The latest project is to build a Vocational Trade school and 10 more children
have been added to the list of recipients.</p>
