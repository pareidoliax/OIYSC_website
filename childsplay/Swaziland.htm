<B><P><A NAME="Swaziland"></A> </B>These groups have partnered with The AIDS Information and Support Centre in Swaziland. This small African country has the highest HIV infection rate in the world - 42.6%. The number of orphans continues to rise and is currently at 69,000 in a population of 1 million. During our recent visit to Swaziland in April/May 2005, the Vunca Sincobe Youth Association pointed out their need for soccer equipment in order to provide physical activity for the youth in the Village of Nkamazi. </P>
<P>Through Canadian Crossroads International, the two organizations are trying to address the impact of HIV/AIDS in the rural Swazi community, as well as helping strengthen the capacity of a local Swazi organization. In the village, Nkamazi, they are working with the leadership of the Youth Association, and a group of peer helpers called the 'Sizanani  Support Group'. Their request for help included a request for soccer balls and shoes for the children of the village. The community is already working on a project to grow vegetables for orphans in the village, as well as a potable water project; and are exploring other ways of helping orphans and vulnerable children in the community especially using sports such as soccer.</P>
<P>Swaziland is named by UNAIDS as the country with the highest rate of HIV infection - in the most recent survey 42.6% of pregnant women were HIV positive. The number of orphans in our partner village is growing at an astounding rate - in six months of last year the number of orphans grew from 77 to 110 (among a total population of 1800).</P>
