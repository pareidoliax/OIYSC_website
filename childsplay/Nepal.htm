</B><P>Childhaven International operate an orphanage in Arubari, a small village about 8km outside of Kathmandu. The orphanage is run by Nepali staff and volunteers from all over the world. There are over 100 boys and girls who live full-time at the orphanage in Arubari. They range in age from 1 year to 18 years although the average age is probably about 8 years old. Not all of the children are orphans but they are all children who were not consistently receiving at least one meal a day before they were taken into the home. At the home they receive 3 meals a day which consists of mostly rice, curried potatoes, lentils and a few vegetables. They also have a machine that produces soy milk from soy beans and each child gets a glass of soy milk twice a day. The home is a modern design and equipped with electric lights, plumbing and a solar hot water heater but a low water table has left the well dry so water must be trucked in a few times a week. The children sleep on the floor, about 10 to a room that is roughly the size of an average North American bedroom.</P>
