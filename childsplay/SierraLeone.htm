<P>The Freetown Y Service club with the support of Y FOCUS, is implementing a training program for unemployed young adults, where they learn about indigenous products they can make and receive basic business training so that they can form co-operatives to provide them with jobs and incomes. 56 young people in 8 communities are being trained during the first year of the program and will be helped to set up their own business usually as a co-operative in groups of 4-5 youth.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P> There is also an orphanage called Jonathan’s House supported by the Y Service club and the YMCA in Freetown. The home is committed to finding kids on the streets and providing food, clothing, shelter, education and medical  treatment.  The children’s fees and uniforms for school are paid for and the YMCA in  Freetown provides administrative support and oversight. There are 62 children in the program, boys and girls of all ages with a budget of $35 000 per year.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Sierra Leone is located in the southwestern part of West Africa and is  about the size of New Brunswick, 72 000 square kilometres. The population is estimated to be just over 4 million but exact numbers are difficult to state due to the displacement and death of so many people during the civil war. Sierra Leone is bound by Guinea to the north and northeast, Liberia to the southeast and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and southwest.</P>

<P>Sierra Leone has a tropical climate with a wet season from May to October and a dry season from November to April. Average annual precipitation varies from 5,080 mm (200 inches) along the coast and decreases inland towards the north to 2,160 mm (86 inches). The prevailing winds are the SW Monsoons during the wet season and the northeastern Harmattan, a dust laden wind from the Sahara Desert, during the dry season. Average temperature ranges in Freetown are from 21 degrees Celsius (73 degrees Fahrenheit) to 31 degrees Celsius (88 degrees Fahrenheit) all year.</P>

<P>The official language is English, although it is only used for government, commerce and media purposes. The principal native languages are Krio which is a form of pidgin English mixed with African words as well as Mende and Temne.  Many individuals speak and understand two or more indigenous languages.</P>
