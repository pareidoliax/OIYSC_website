infected and affected by HIV/AIDS in this rural area of Tanzania in the
Kilimanjaro Region. MKUKI has provided many programs for orphans, who have
lost parents to HIV/AIDS. MKUKI works closely with the schools in their
area where principals and teachers identify the orphans in most critical
need. Most recently they have started a school lunch program that provides
a nutritious noon meal for the orphans at these schools.
<p><i>"Through this network of schools we, Mkuki, are able to distribute
the soccer balls you donated. This is a huge gift for these children who
already have suffered so much in their young lives. This will bring endless
enjoyment to so many children who rarely, if ever, see or use a new soccer
ball - but love the game of soccer!! "</i> (From the president of Canadian
Support of Rural African Initiatives CSRAI)

at cost.
<p>A note from Melanie: "<i>I am a medical student at the University of
Toronto, and I am travelling to Cameroon for two months (June and July)
with 4 other medical students and 2 engineers. WE have raised over $10
000 CDN to build two wells in two small communities so that the villagers
can access clean water. We are working with a local NGO called PIPAD, and
they have already done hygiene education in these communities. While we
are in Cameroon we are also hoping to do HIV/AIDS education with children,
and have some fun approaches for doing this through sport. I would like
to bring a number of school quality soccer balls with me to facilitate
this and to leave with the local children. Our funds are somewhat limited
as our primary commitment is to building the wells."</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>July</b>
<p>10 new soccer balls and 10 assorted volleyballs to Tanzania with CSRAI.
These were delivered to the President of CSRAI during the Canada – U.S.
Area Convention in Charlottetown, P.E.I. This was in response to the following
e-mail from Bonnie Gray.
<p>"<i>I have attached for you some photos from my recent 2 month working
visit to our partner NGO, MKUKI, in Tanzania. They were the recipient of
the soccer balls you had donated and I wanted to convey to you the great
impact they are having with the children. Several of the balls are being
used by the teen students of the MKUKI vocational school. The boys and
their instructors are having regular soccer matches now and it is part
of the regular curriculum. What a tremendous boost to morale it is! And
it was particularly heart-warming for me to see these students clearly
having so much FUN given most of them are HIV/AIDS orphans. The girls do
not typically play soccer there so they are using soccer balls for netball
and other games. (I just got an email that they have also started playing
volleyball with them.) You can certainly see by their faces how much they
are enjoying themselves! Several of these girls were AMAZING natural athletes
and I am sure they could give the boys a run for their money on the soccer
field if they had been trained for soccer!</i>
<p><i>Last, but certainly not least, soccer balls were given to Mkyashi
Primary School and Kilema Primary School. The combined enrolment at these
schools is over 2,000 and they are EXTREMELY grateful to this equipment
as they told me first hand. So, Dave, I had the good fortune to receive
their thanks directly and I want to pass that gratitude directly to you
and Y Focus Fair Trade Sports. Again, MANY thanks, from CSRAI, MKUKI and
all the students who are benefiting from your donation, warm regards,"</i>

purchased with a donation from funds raised by the sale of Fair Trade coffee
at the Chelsea Craft Fair on December 3<sup>rd</sup>.
<p><i>Through Canadian Crossroads International, AIDS St John is working
to address the impact of HIV/AIDS in the rural Swazi community, as well
as helping strengthen the capacity of a local Swazi organization. In the
village, Nkamazi, they are working with the leadership of the Youth Association,
and a group of peer helpers called the 'Sizanani</i>
<p><i>Support Group'. Their request for help included a request for soccer
balls and shoes for the children of the village. The community is already
working on a project to grow vegetables for orphans in the village, as
well as a potable water project; and are exploring other ways of helping
orphans and vulnerable children in the community especially using sports
such as soccer.</i>
<p><i>Swaziland is named by UNAIDS as the country with the highest rate
of HIV infection - in the most recent survey 42.6% of pregnant women were
HIV positive. The number of orphans in our partner village is growing at
an astounding rate - in six months of last year the number of orphans grew
from 77 to 110 (among a total population of 1800).</i>
