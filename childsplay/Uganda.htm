<p><font size="2">Black, yellow, red were the colours of the Uganda People's 
Congress party, who came to power in elections in April 1962. The flag was 
adopted on the date of independence, 9 Oct 1962. To quote Whitney Smith ("</font><a href="bib-smi.html#smi76a"><font size="2">
 Spectrum Vlaggenboek</font></a>
 <font size="2">", 1975): "The three colours were intended to symbolise the 
people of Africa, sunshine and brotherhood. The design was made by the Minister 
of Justice, Mr Grace Ibingira." The crested crane was the flag badge of Uganda 
under British colonial rule. <br>
