<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>South Africa</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>&#9;Here is some information  about the country and the particular project you will be helping with your donations.</P>

<B><P>The agency we are supporting  is the Wakefield Grannies based in Wakefield, Quebec.   </B></FONT><A HREF="http://www.thegrannies.org/"><FONT SIZE=2>www.thegrannies.org</FONT></A><B><FONT SIZE=2> </P>

<P>In many countries, there are many grandmothers now left with grandchildren to look after since their parents have died. The Wakefield Grannies are a group of women offering support to AIDs orphans and their Grandmothers in Alexandra Township, South Africa. The Wakefield Grannies provide direct financial assistance to the Tara Hospital Children's Clinic, and by keeping a correspondence with the individual women who attend the clinic’s program.</P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P>The Background</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>On a visit to Quebec in 2004, Rose Letwaba spoke about her work to a small audience in the Wakefield United Church.  Rose is a nurse in the health clinic in Alexandra Township on the outskirts of Johannesburg, South Africa.  The picture she painted was of a whole generation of South Africans lost to AIDs and grieving mothers left to carry the burden of raising their grandchildren to be healthy, educated and socially responsible adults.  Rose described a group of 40 such Grannies who were meeting at her clinic for sewing classes, gardening and moral support.  </P>

<P>Spontaneously, 12 Wakefield women, lead by Norma Geggie (81) came together to help, becoming the first Grannies to link with the Alexandra Grannies or GoGos to use the South African word.  </P>

</FONT><B><FONT SIZE=3><P>Today</P>
</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>The Wakefield Grannies are committed to providing financial assistance to their counterparts in Alexandra. To do this they produce fundraising events.</P>

<P>Each Wakefield Granny also has an individual GoGo to whom they write letters.  It may seem that raising money is the most important aspect of their activities.  In fact, Rose Letwaba wrote after some South African GoGos received letters from Canada that &quot;Morale is high in these groups and there is a lot of hope, just the idea and the thought that there are Grannies on the other side of the world who care so much about them, make these groups appreciate life…&quot;</P>

<P>Greater Alexandra is in the north-eastern suburbs of Johannesburg on the banks of the Jukskei River. The population of the area is about 350 000 people. The area has about 4 060 formal houses and 34 000 shacks. In addition there are various other forms of accommodation including hostels, flats (i.e. apartments) and warehouses. he area has many problems which include:</P>
<P>* High levels of unemployment (60%) resulting in poverty. The lowest incomes occur in Old Alexandra and the Women’s Hostel.</P>
<P>* Most residents are unskilled and there are few professional workers.</P>
<P>* Areas where education levels are low for example the hostels and the Wynberg Marlboro area.</P>
<P>* No urban management resulting in residents ignoring building regulations and zoning laws.</P>
<P>* High levels of non-payment for local government services and accommodation.</P>
<P>* Serious overcrowding with extremely high densities. This places a major strain on engineering and social services, health conditions and results in high levels of social stress and crime</P>
