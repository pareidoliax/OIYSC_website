Community.</font></b>
<p><b>What does it mean to become and remain a Fair Trade Community?</b>
<p>Suggestions for YMCAs, schools, churches and other community groups
<br>There are four steps:
<ol>
<li>
Adopt a Statement of Principle. This may be provided by the national organization
or a local administrative unit such as a school board. (A sample motion
is provided)</li>

<li>
Establish an Ethical Purchasing policy that matches the needs and resources
of your particular organization, to be implemented wherever possible, recognizing
the constraints of the budget and the increased costs that may result.</li>

<br>Include products that are certified Fair Trade, are Sweat-free and
that are produced and used without harming the environment. Include a provision
to avoid buying from companies deemed to be getting their goods from companies
that include sweatshop labour, children as workers, poor and unsafe working
conditions and lax environmental controls. Follow an ethical investment
policy for all funds.
<li>
Develop an ongoing campaign of awareness of the issues primarily among
your members and contacts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Discuss fully with the membership
the rationale for ethical purchasing and the costs associated with such
a decision.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Host visiting Fair Trade producers. Such tours are organized by groups
such as Transfair Canada and Oxfam.</li>

<li>
Purchase Fair Trade items such as coffee, tea, chocolate for special functions
and everyday use in cafeterias, coffee machines and snack bars.</li>

<li>
Make available to the staff and membership Fair Trade items for purchase.
Selections of items are available from groups such as Bridgehead and Coco
Camino for gifts and for fund raising campaigns.</li>

<li>
Carry items in newsletters about latest news of Fair Trade products and
actions by other groups in support of No Sweat and Fair Trade.</li>

<li>
Display and make available any lists of Fair Trade companies in your area
and encourage members to shop there.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
Take specific actions to promote Fair Trade to the general public.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Organize or support Fair Trade Fairs for local Fair Trade businesses.</li>

<li>
Organize or support Fair Trade events such as soccer and volleyball tournaments</li>

<li>
Encourage other groups such as local school boards and city councils to
adopt Ethical Purchasing policies, such as have been adopted by the cities
of Vancouver and San Francisco and several Catholic school boards.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>A resolution in favour of an Ethical Purchasing policy for churches,
YMCAs and other community groups.</b>
<p>Whereas: <u>(Name of Organization )</u> supports the building of awareness
among our members and the community on issues related to sweatshop production
facilities and the exploitation of vulnerable workers such as women, children
and prison inmates and
<p>Whereas: We wish to take positive action against the evils of child
labour, child prostitution, slave labour and unregulated dangerous working
conditions and&nbsp;
<p>Whereas: There are existing and improving methods of verifying producers
who compete by exploiting their workers and&nbsp;
<p>Whereas: There are alternative methods of production to those of large
corporations that control the supply and prices of goods and
<p>Whereas: It is evident that pressure from institutional purchasers,
their staff and members is an effective way to promote improved working
conditions and wages and to end the exploitation of vulnerable workers
such as women and children
<p>Be it resolved that (name of organization) adopt a policy of purchasing
goods wherever possible, that can be verified as being either Sweat Free
or Fair Trade certified, that is, they are produced by worker owned co-operatives
and companies that do not exploit their workers and that provide fair wages
and safe, healthy working conditions.

<br><b><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>How to Get a "Fair Trade - No Sweat"
Policy at your School</font></font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>Many high schools bulk-purchase clothing – school uniforms,
team uniforms, band uniforms and/or staff uniforms. And other schools bulk
purchase clothes bearing the school name and insignia. A great way to raise
awareness about sweatshop conditions and the use of child labour is to
promote developing an Ethical Purchasing policy, a "Fair Trade – No Sweat"
policy.&nbsp;</font>
<p><font size=-1>Fair Trade products are mostly agricultural such as tea,
coffee, sugar and chocolate. However there are now other items such as
Fair Trade sports balls and cut flowers available as well as handcrafts,
household items, toys and gifts.. Schools and staff use can use most of
these products and should be encouraged to look for these items.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Here’s how:</font>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Organize a Fair Trade - No Sweat committee: </b>Potential members include:
students and teachers from your school and other schools in your board,
members of Student Council or other school groups, parents, school or board
alumni, retired teachers, staff and members of organizations like Development
and Peace, Maquila Solidarity Network, OXFAM, OECTA, etc. Likely you will
initially be a small group, but continue to seek out new members.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Research and Develop allies:&nbsp;</b></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>
Check the labels of your school clothing and make sure the symbol of Transfair
Canada is on all products which claim to be Fair Trade or free of child
labour. Find out who makes the products and in what countries?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Find out who’s responsible for policy decisions about uniforms, sports
balls, coffee supplies etc – the school board? The school? The athletics
department? If the school board makes the purchasing decisions or sets
policies for such decisions (most likely), contact your local trustee.
The trustee can tell you about the current policy (if there is one) regarding
school uniforms, and the steps you need to take to change it. If your trustee
isn’t very sympathetic, call another trustee who might be more helpful.<font size=-1>&nbsp;</font></li>

<li>
Find out what other students have done and components of a good policy
(<font size=-1><a href="http://www.maquilasolidarity.org/">www.maquilasolidarity.org</a></font>
and Hamilton initiative: <b><font face="Arial"><font size=-1>wydnsi@yahoo.com</font></font></b>).&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Seek out support for initiative:. e.g. student clubs, parent organizations,
teacher and support staff unions, sympathetic school board members, Development
and Peace members and local Fair Trade groups.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Make a Presentation to the School Board: </b>Request to speak at a Board
meeting. Share with the trustees the importance of such things as child
labour, safe working conditions and fair wages, full public disclosure
and other components of a strong ethical purchasing policy, and recommend
that the Board develop a policy and include members of your committee on
the policy writing team. Share your passion for improving labour conditions
and emphasize the power of the Board to make a difference. Provide an info
package to Board members.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Participate in the Writing of the Fair Trade - No Sweat policy: </b>One
of the best strategies to ensuring a strong policy, is have representatives
from your committee on the Board policy writing committee. While working
on this committee, be sure to receive support from members of your committee
and outside organizations with expertise as the language is critical to
a strong policy and it can be a tough negotiation process. Stick to your
principles.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
<b>Presentation of policy to the Board of Trustees: </b>Prior to the meeting,
get a copy of the proposed Ethical Purchasing policy. If the policy is
weak, it is critical that you contact the trustees to explain to them the
weaknesses and to suggest appropriate action (amendments, voting no, etc).
Organize an urgent action campaign to lobby trustees to take action. Request
an opportunity to speak at the Board meeting when the vote on the new policy
will happen. Use this moment to reiterate publicly your opinion of policy.</li>

<br><a NAME="Fredericton"></a><b>Fredericton (Canada) YMCA – Purchasing
guidelines.</b>
<p>Section 12.2 of the Orientation Handbook. "No Sweat Purchasing Guidelines"
<p>It is in the interest of the Fredericton YMCA to purchase goods and
services from responsible manufacturers that provide quality products and
services at a competitive price; however the Fredericton YMCA does not
want to do business with companies that compete by exploiting their workers.
<p>There have been many recent reports of worker rights abuses and sweatshop
conditions, such as poverty wages, excessive hours of work, discrimination,
abusive treatment, child labor and failure to provide statutory benefits.
It is evident that pressure from institutional purchasers such as the Fredericton
YMCA is an effective way to combat sweatshop practices.
<p>As an organization, the Fredericton YMCA chooses to allocate its purchasing
dollars in order to enhance, rather than degrade, the economic and social
well being of garment workers.
<p>Therefore the Fredericton YMCA will make a conscious effort to ensure
that all apparel and textile goods purchased by the Fredericton YMCA, whether
produced in Canada or abroad, are manufactured in accordance with the local
labor laws and the international labor standards of the International Labor
Organization Conventions regarding wages, hours of work, workplace health
and safety, forced labor, child labor and freedom of associations and collective
bargaining and any other relevant conventions.
<p>Prior to purchasing textile goods, the staff will affirm with the Administration
Office that the vendor has signed the prepared document confirming<b> </b>their
compliance with these conditions<b>.</b><b></b>

<br><a NAME="Hamilton policy"></a> <b><font size=+1>Contents of a typical
School Board No Sweat Purchasing policy.</font></b><font size=+1></font>
<p><b>(Based on the policy of the Hamilton (Ontario) Catholic School Board.</b>
<p><b>Summary: </b>A No Sweat purchasing policy requires licencees and/or
apparel suppliers to provide verifiable assurances that their products
are made under conditions that comply with international labour standards
and local laws. There is recognition that no work place is perfect and
that achieving and maintaining compliance with ethical licencing and purchasing
policies is an ongoing process.
<p><b>Sections:</b>
<p><b>1.&nbsp; Compliance with national Labour Laws and International Standards.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Safe, Just and Healthy Employment Standards</b>
<p><b>2. Public Disclosure of Factory Locations</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Prior to signing of any contract/licensing agreement, suppliers shall publicly
disclose to the Board the location of all factories involved in the manufacture
of the products to be supplied. This information is to be provided on the
Board’s prescribed disclosure forms which in turn shall be considered public
information.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Board will ensure that the disclosed information will be available
to the public upon request.</b>
<p><b>3. Internal Monitoring by the company:</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Annual Public Reports</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Suppliers should be required to provide annual, public reports on their
progress in achieving compliance with the No Sweat policy. Reports should
include:</b>
<br><b>-&nbsp; information on the supplier’s monitoring and verification
program;</b>
<br><b>- the name of the third-party auditing organization if they are
using one;</b>
<br><b>- the findings of monitoring and third-party audits; and</b>
<br><b>- a summary of corrective action taken and efforts to promote sustainable
solutions to persistent problems.</b>
<p><b>4. External Verification by a Third Party - Third Party Factory Monitoring</b>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Clothing suppliers should also be required to allow factory monitoring
by acceptable third-party and independent monitors when there are complaints
of workers’ rights abuses. The Board shall designate a third party, like
WRC (Workers Rights Consortium), to carry out any investigation and report
their findings to the Board. In addition, the Fair Labour Association (FLA)
has a monitoring and reporting program that can be accessed.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The findings of third-party audits are to be made available to the institution,
the people making the complaint, and the public.</b>
<p><b>5. Corrective Action.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Few, if any, factories are totally free from violations and the institution
must be prepared to receive complaints. Manufacturers should be given sufficient
time and opportunities to achieve compliance. The supplier should provide
the Institution with a corrective action plan, including reasonable deadlines.
The institution has the authority to terminate the contract if the supplier
does not comply.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Board will exercise its mandate to insist that corrective action be
taken by the company in the shortest period of time possible but not longer
than 6 months. If the supplier/licensee fails and/or refuses to rectify
the concerns to the satisfaction of the Board’s designate, the Board or
school principal shall terminate the contract.</b>
<p><b>6. Responding to Complaints</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Suppliers should be required to respond to all legitimate complaints with
verified evidence that the violations have either not occurred or corrective
action has been taken.</b>
<p><b>7. Compliance Form</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Suppliers should be required to complete and sign a compliance form that
describes and details all the expectations the institution’s policy enforces
as a condition of business.</b>
<p><b>8. Annual letter to uniform suppliers</b>
<p><b>9. List of approved suppliers</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the beginning of each March the Board shall make known to all schools
through the principal who have met requirements of this policy.</b>

<br><a NAME="Vancouver"></a><b><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>From:
Michael Zelmer of the Vancouver Fair Trade Coffee Network. February, 2005.</font></font></b>
<p><b>The Ethical Purchasing Policy (EPP) and Supplier Code of Conduct
(SCC) for the City of Vancouver and other partners passed the final hurdle
recently.</b>
<br><b>To get the final version of the SCC and EPP, as well as the report
by staff on the process and costs of the policy, (and a video clip on the
meeting) follow this link:</b>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1><a href="http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/20050217/cs20050217.htm">http://vancouver.ca/ctyclerk/cclerk/20050217/cs20050217.htm</a>
(It's item #7)&nbsp;</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>This policy sets out the ethical
requirements for all City purchases of apparel and "Fair Trade agricultural
products". In a nutshell, the City can't buy apparel that doesn't meet
the International Labour Organizations' (ILO) core conventions, and must
buy Fair Trade certified agricultural products whenever possible. "Whenever
possible" means subject to supply... so since the FT certified coffee market
can easily supply the City's needs, all City coffee will be FT certified.
Other products (like rice, for instance), may require more time.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>With the decision to allow for
only FT certified products, in order to have the City commit to buying
FT products, we needed to present them with a system in which they could
feel confident that they weren't going to get bitten in the ass. By only
allowing FT certified goods, the City wouldn't be responsible for costly
(time, money, and personel) auditing of supply chains, since that would
be handled by Transfair/FLO. As well, if there was ever a scandal involving
a certified product that wasn't as ethical as it seemed, the City would
have some distance from it since they would have been relying on an internationally
recognized system (i.e. the problem would have been with FLO/Transfair
if such a situation ever arose).</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>In Vancouver, there are 4 non-certified
coffee "brands" of importance: Development and Peace, Cafe Etico, Cafe
Justicia, and Level Ground Trading. Of those, one is now partly certified
and increasing certification for the rest of its product lines, another
is in the process of being certified, and the other two aren't certified
yet. The fact that EVERY roaster makes the claim that they're ethical (never
mind suppliers of other products like tea, chocolate, sugar, fruit, etc),
and that we couldn't be sure that the City would be able to acquire the
knowledge necessary to adequately screen bogus claims, insisting on certification
was the best way to go.</font></font>
<p><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1>Staff estimated total costs to
the City to be just below of $600 000 for the coming year (including additional
staff requirements and one time consultancy fees for implementation purposes)
(see report). The report makes no investigation of the City's ability to
recover/reduce some of these costs through adjusting retail prices at concession
stands, or the quantity of these goods that it consumes.</font></font><font face="Courier New"><font size=-1></font></font>

<br><a NAME="No Sweat"></a><b>What’s the difference between No Sweat and
Fair Trade campaigns?</b>
<br>From Dave Hall, Y FOCUS Fair Trade Sports
<br>Both campaigns are aimed at improving wages, health and safety in the
workplace, ending the exploitation of women and children and providing
workers with an active role in the decisions made in the work place and
community.
<p>No Sweat campaigns are largely directed at large companies, selling
clothing and accessories, where the work is outsourced to factories scattered
throughout developing countries where labour is cheap and plentiful. Third
party monitoring and reporting are carried out by such groups as the Workers
Rights Consortium and the Fair Labour Association.
<p>Fair Trade campaigns tend to focus on smaller producers, often locally
owned farmer and worker owned co-operatives as the alternative to large
corporations who might dominate and control a particular segment of the
industry such as bananas or cocoa. Most Fair Trade products are agricultural
but the list has expanded to include handcrafts, toys, sports balls and
cut flowers. Fair Trade producers and manufacturers are certified, licenced
and monitored by the Fairtrade Labeling organization based in Germany.
In the countries where Fair Trade products are sold, importers are certified
by FLO and the corresponding national Fair Trade organization such as Transfair
Canada.
