<a NAME="RENEWAL 2000 CONFERENCE REPORT - Central Canada"></a><b>RENEWAL
2000 CONFERENCE REPORT - Central Canada Region</b></li>
</ul>
In November 2000, club representatives in Central Canada region met to
discuss how to renew club strength in the region. Prior to the conference
a survey of clubs produced the following list of concerns in order of priority.
<ul>
<li>
Not recruiting enough members</li>

<li>
Low level of community recognition and inadequate promotional work</li>

<li>
Lack of proper training</li>

<li>
Not enough communication between clubs</li>

<li>
Lack of Y support</li>

<li>
Problems in keeping members</li>
</ul>
The group worked on four questions dealing with the #1 priority, recruiting
and keeping members.
<p>What do we have to offer existing and prospective members?
<p>How can we strengthen these aspects of our clubs?
<p>Is what we have to offer meeting the needs of the members and prospectives?
<p>If not, what else should we be looking at?
<p>Four clear directions emerged from the discussion.
<ul>
<li>
Each club needs to offer a wider variety of opportunities for involvement
incorporating more group activities, clear objectives, specific time commitments.</li>

<li>
Clubs need to stress out international focus by increasing our understanding
of current issues, supporting the projects of other clubs and supporting
directly the work of clubs in developing countries.</li>

<li>
Clubs must present an open invitation to men and women of all ages, ethnic
groups and faiths and include the whole family.</li>

<li>
Clubs must work to build a fellowship based on respect, tolerance, equality
and support for individual members while operating in a responsible, professional
manner.</li>
</ul>
Within each area the group came up with some specific suggestions for club
action
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVOLVEMENT.</li>
</ul>
Under this topic, we set out three guidelines.
<p>1.Clubs need to provide a wider range of activities to meet individual
needs and skills of existing and prospective members.
<p>2. Clubs need to provide as many group activities as possible to build
fellowship and involve new people.
<p>3. As much as possible, activities should be short-term with a definite
time frame and clear objectives. Four general recommendations were developed
with several ideas for implementation.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>A. Use the overall international theme "Say No To Violence" </b>as
an impetus for more member involvement and closer co-operation with the
Y and other
community groups.
<p>Possible we need to add to the theme a phrase such as " Build a Culture
of Peace" and develop ideas for projects in each local community as well
as internationally.
<p>A big step would be to set up programs of awareness of the issues, in
the Y and in the community.
<p>Identify and support local community initiatives. Members choose which
ones they might take part in and in turn invite others to participate.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>B. Determine what we have to offer as a club and determine ways to
expand the options.</b> First review existing service and fund raising
projects and outline the needs we have for volunteers and donations.
<p>Get a complete list of Y projects where the club might be able to offer
assistance, their "wish list"
<p>Explore the possibility of assisting other agencies in the community
who have similar objectives to ours. Members could provide volunteer help
in "hands on" work and in organization, with Children's Aid Societies,
shelters for the homeless, Food Banks and many more.
<p>The main idea coming from the discussions was that we do not always
need to develop and organize more new projects but to plug into already
established projects, thus reducing the strain on our present human resources.
This requires a good knowledge of what is happening in your community already.
Also there will be more opportunities to approach people in the community
for help in our work which may also lead to finding new members. We will
be able to do more service with the same number of members.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>C. Find out what people might be looking for in a Y Service club.</b>
An obvious target group for a random survey would be Y users using a professionally
developed questionnaire. Every club would use the same survey and share
results. Possibly set up a booth in the Y lobby at different times to sample
different groups of Y users. Offer an incentive for completing the survey,
e.g. entry into a draw for a free Christmas tree. Do the survey as part
of an already planned event. An alternative might be to include some questions
in the Y's registration material or newsletter. Keep it short. We need
to decide what we want to find out and what we want to tell people about
our movement.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>D. We must share information with other clubs and with YMCAs</b>
to stimulate more ideas and to support each others initiatives. Later under
the topic of International Outreach some specific examples of possible
inter-club co-operation were put forward.
<p>Using electronic communications we should be able to keep our members
and the YMCAs in Central Canada informed of our work.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
BUILDING OUR INTERNATIONAL EMPHASIS</li>
</ul>
There are some of our present international projects that deserve to be
promoted to prospective members in more detail. Perhaps a key group we
want to target for membership are people already interested in international
issues around peace, development, understanding and justice.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>A. Stress the opportunities available for exchanges and international
contacts</b> starting with the STEP program for young people since there
continue to be difficulties in expanding the YEEP program.
<p>Brother clubs in developing countries offer possibilities for direct
support to worthwhile projects.
<p>Support existing exchange programs for Y staff and volunteers.
<p>Have all regional clubs support the special programs that some of our
clubs have already started. For example:
<p>Cambridge is involved in a youth exchange program between Canada, The
U.S. and Mexico called "Mano a Mano" Clubs with interested young people
can plug into this program.
<p>North York has links with an organization, Friends of the Poor, that
sends work parties to countries like Jamaica to help in building houses
and schools in poor areas. They would welcome members of other clubs and
volunteers from other Y's who would like to go.
<p>Ottawa has helped develop a major project in Sierra Leone and is raising
funds
there directly as a result of their Brother Club relationship with Freetown
Y Service club.
<p>Sault Ste Marie has contacts with an "adopt a child" project in Sri
Lanka that is being run by a Y Service club there. There may be other such
club activities around the world where we can offer support or where we
can participate directly.
<p><u>The principle here is that if another club has a good project which
members of our clubs might wish to support, make sure the opportunity is
there and the information available</u>. We need to gather as much information
as possible and make sure every club has it.
<p>We need to establish closer links with Y Canada International Development
staff in Toronto.
<p>Clubs can develop one time international projects such as an evening
of letter writing, to Brother Clubs, for Amnesty International or for urging
government action on important international issues such as debt cancellation.
<p>We need to take the leadership in our Y's in developing awareness of
issues with displays, speakers and activities with youth.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
TOWARDS A MORE OPEN, INVITING FELLOWSHIP</li>
</ul>
<b>A. Build bridges between our clubs and different ethnic groups in the
community.</b>
<p>Support other ethnic associations in their charitable work with volunteers
and expertise.
<br>Support Y projects that reach out to ethnic groups and minorities.
<br>Have joint meetings with community ethnic groups, celebrations, provide
speakers for each others groups.
<br>Carry out visible international projects which local ethnic groups
can support. For example Ottawa's project in Sierra Leone has brought them
together with the Sierra Leone Descendants Union.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>B. Provide a more inviting milieu for single professional women (and
men?)</b><b></b>
<p>Be more professional, in the conduct of meetings, in the treatment of
other members, in the production and use of publicity material, in the
operation of fundraising events.
<br>Have clear and specific goals for the club mission. Set out specific
time commitments for activities and stick to them. Free time is scarce
and people want to be able to help by using their available time productively
and enjoyably.
<br>Invite people to help in a specific way, using their talents and interests
appropriately.
<br>Consider special community projects that might recognize people in
the community for their contributions with a special award. These could
provide needed club exposure and give you a reason to involve professionals
in business and other fields.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>C. Provide opportunities for seniors and retirees</b><b></b>
<p>Accessible facilities and activities.
<br>Use their talents properly at the level of involvement they can handle.
<br>Give opportunities to contribute, using the special knowledge and expertise
that comes form a life of experience.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
BUILD ON OUR CHRISTIAN BASE.</li>
</ul>
Point out our commonalities with all major religions
<br>Maintain close contacts with churches of members and other faith groups
such as the Jubilee Coalition.
<br>Clubs could worship together once a year in a members church.
<br>Celebrate events in the Christian calendar in the Y - carol singing.
<br>Get the Y to provide a "prayer" room. Help set it up.
<br>A Remembrance Day cross in the lobby.
<br>People with a strong faith may be our best source of long time members.

<a NAME="RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLUB ACTION"></a><b>RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLUB
ACTION - from the Renewal 2000 conference</b></li>
</ul>

<p><br><b><font face="Times New Roman">EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBER
INVOLVEMENT.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Review and evaluate existing community
and international service projects. Is this the best mix to keep your members
active and enthusiastic?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Do you have enough variety to attract
new people? If you need to make improvements here are some ideas.</font>
<p>&nbsp;2. Work with your Y to set up a list of their projects you can
support, spread them <font face="Times New Roman">out through they year
and chose those that fit the needs and abilities of your club members.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Include in your service outreach, support
for community groups with whom you have ideals and objectives in common.
Instead of just writing a cheque, look at how individual members can get
involved with these groups, as representatives of your club with full club
support.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Find out what other clubs in the Region/Area
are doing and look at ways to help them.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">5. When you look at supporting Y and community
projects, plug into International, Area and Regional themes, especially
"Say No To Violence". Such unifying themes identify the club as a special
group in the community.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">6. Set up a communications strategy that
shares your successes (and failures) with other clubs as well as Y staff,
club contacts and other community groups.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">7. Survey the public, starting with Y users,
to find out what they would look for in a Y Service club which they might
consider joining.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">BUILDING A MORE OPEN, INVITING FELLOWSHIP.</font></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Evaluate all aspects of meetings and
programs which affect the first impressions of any guests. Are we as professional
as possible in our actions and operations? Do we really welcome people
of all ages and ethnic backgrounds? Are we attractive to professional people,
especially women and&nbsp; do we really accomodate the whole family? If
not, decide on what changes you need to make.</font><font face="Times New Roman"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Share with other clubs what works for
you and find out what other clubs are doing.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">EXPANDING YPOUR INTERNATIONAL INVOLVEMENT</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">1. Take your existing international projects
and look at how to expand them to involve more people in the community.
Look at STEP, Brother Club partnerships and joint projects, Time of Fast,
any programs that would benefit from or interest community and Y volunteers
and Y staff.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">2. Look at other international projects
operated by other Y Service clubs around the world. Offer your members
the opportunity to become involved.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3. Look at projects of other international
organizations and support interested members who wish to be involved on
behalf of the club.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">4. Take on programs to raise awareness
of issues within the Y community.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">MAKING OUR CHRISTIAN FAITH A MORE VITAL
PART OF CLUB LIFE.</font></b><b></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Evaluate the role of Christianity in your
service and fellowship.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">How can we be true to the teachings of
Jesus Christ? How can we build a fellowship that is Christ-centred?</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">Can we establish closer links with other
faith groups in the community and share resources and inspiration?</font>

<a NAME="RECRUITING TIPS"></a><b><font face="Times New Roman">RECRUITING
TIPS</font></b></li>
</ul>
<font face="Times New Roman">(How to invite someone to join the club and
have a reasonable chance they will come to at least one meeting.)</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">New members don't just appear, they
have to be invited to a meeting. Preparing to deliver that invitation seems
to be difficult for many members for several reasons :</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">- some do not feel comfortable asking
others to join in case the invitation is rejected.</font></b><b><font face="Times New Roman"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">- some do not know how to go about raising
the subject and need assurance that whatever the result, a friendship is
not in jeopardy.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">- some feel they are just not salespersons.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Here are a few tips to help you overcome
your misgivings and make that first invitation.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">REMEMBER YOU ARE NOT DOING THIS FOR
YOURSELF BUT FOR THE PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHO WILL BENEFIT FROM OUR
HELP!</font></b><b><font face="Times New Roman"></font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Think of the benefits to your club and
your fellowship together!!</font></b>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">The larger the club membership, the more
service work we can do. More members usually increases the opportunities
for fellowship, for making new friends and for personal growth. You could
also enjoy the club more with more people to share the load.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">BE REALISTIC AND DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH!</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Operate on the 20% rule. If you ask 10
people to join you may get 2 to come to a meeting. You can greatly improve
these odds if you plan ahead and use some of the ideas outlined here.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">THINK IN TERMS OF A THREE STEP PROCESS.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Scouting the Field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Laying the groundwork&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Issuing
the invitation.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">STEP 1. Scouting the Field.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever you meet someone new, an early
thought should be- "Would this person make a good club member?"</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Keep a mental list and add people who have
the values, personality and background that appeals to you. Make an effort
to get to know people who:</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">- are in your church or are already involved
in the community</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">- have young people who might benefit
from our youth exchanges</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">- are facing or who have just started
retirement</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">- are experiencing the "empty nest" syndrome
where their children have all left home.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Find out about jobs, family, community
involvement, interests and hobbies. Look for a fit between their interests
and the work of the club and start talking up Y'sdom.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">STEP 2. Laying the Groundwork.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Be proud of your membership. Whenever you
get the chance, talk about the club, its projects and your involvement.
The best candidates for an invitation are those who ask about your involvement
and show an interest in the clubs work. IF YOU ARE LUCKY THEY WILL ASK
FOR MORE INFORMATION WITHOUT PROMPTING.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">If someone shows an interest in a particular
area, you can invite them to help in a specific event, a service project
or fund raising event, such as selling Christmas Trees, collecting stamps,
contributing to a sale.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Start keeping a record.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">After some initial contacts, you may decide
someone is worth inviting to a meeting. To make the invitation attractive
you need to find out the values and interests of that person, such things
as those outlined in our induction ceremony - Idealism, international outlook,
enthusiastic, supportive of the Y , responsible and with a strong spiritual
belief.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">With a list by your telephone you will
be reminded to keep in touch and look for the opportunity to make that
invitation.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">STEP 3. Issuing the invitation.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Timing is everything</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Surveys show that the best time to recruit
people for volunteer work is late summer to early fall when people are
looking for something new to do. The next best time is around Christmas
and the New Year.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Another consideration is the stage in a
person's life as when :</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">Young people are just finished university
and have their first job.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">Young couples have their children now in school.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">Middle-aged couples have children who have
just left home.</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Times New Roman">Recent retirees have extra time to get involved.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><br><b><font face="Times New Roman">Keep a list.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Every so often, especially during the summer,
sit down and review the list of people you have met during the past year.
Set some priorities and concentrate on those who have something in common
with the ideals of the club.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Choose the right activity for the invitation</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You have to decide which club event will
be the best for you to bring your guest.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">- a regular dinner which is more formal
but hopefully informative and fun.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">- a social occasion where your guest can
meet others informally.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">- a project where most of the club are
involved.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Be aware of the process for becoming
a member and the resources the club has available.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We do not want to rush someone into membership
but also we cannot drag the process out. A prospective member should be
able to determine in 2-3 months whether he/she is interested in making
a commitment. In that time ask people to attend at least three meetings
before making a decision. There may also be an orientation session and
of course the club bulletin is sent out to them and they are put on the
phoning list.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Clubs should have - a Guest Pak for their
first meeting</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- a Club Membership booklet for the orientation night.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
- a New Member Kit for the Induction Ceremony</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The best resource for a new member is YOU,
the sponsor. Your responsibilities as a recruiter do not end with an induction
though everyone in the club is expected to join in and support a new member.
Many clubs assign a "buddy" to help the sponsor keep up the regular contact.
Surveys indicate that member dropout occurs usually in their first two
years. It is a lot easier to keep a member than find a new one but it still
needs effort.</font><font face="Times New Roman"></font>

<li>
<a NAME="WHAT YOUR CLUB CAN DO"></a><font size=+2>WHAT YOUR CLUB CAN DO
!!!&nbsp; </font>Ideas from the Canada-U.S. Area Convention in Toledo,
July, 1999.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp; 1. Make clubs more open and inclusive:
<br>&nbsp;- involve the whole family in activities
<br>&nbsp;- actively recruit women
<br>&nbsp;- consider subsidizing membership fees
<br>&nbsp;- involve youth in service early
<br>&nbsp;- respond to the needs of parents.
<br>&nbsp;- set targets for recruitment
<br>&nbsp;- be more flexible in meetings and programs
<br>&nbsp;- less formality, more fun, fellowship and spontaneity.
<p>2. Work with and listen to youth.
<br>&nbsp;- start a youth section
<br>&nbsp;- start a second club for younger people
<br>&nbsp;- work with or adopt existing youth groups, in the Y, churches,
schools.
<br>&nbsp;- carry out high profile work with young people or in areas youth
relate to.
<br>&nbsp;- think young, listen to and educate youth.
<p>3. Establish incentives, remove impediments to getting and keeping members.
<br>&nbsp;- create a flexible dues structure with youth and family memberships
<br>&nbsp;- provide more opportunities for personal development.
<br>&nbsp;- provide more flexibility in time commitments
<br>&nbsp;- more hands-on, group service opportunities.
<br>&nbsp;- broaden the focus of service to accommodate different interests.
<br>&nbsp;- be open to new ideas
<br>&nbsp;- have a clear focus or mission.
<p>4. Develop among the members a feeling that they belong to a larger,
world-wide family.
<br>&nbsp;- more interclub visits and communication.
<br>&nbsp;- more sharing of information and ideas among clubs
<br>&nbsp;- improve intra-club communication using electronic technology
<p>5. Stress our service involvement and increase service opportunities
for members.
<br>&nbsp;- more community service in general
<br>&nbsp;- hands-on projects that involve the whole family and friends
<br>&nbsp;- keep abreast of changing community needs
<br>&nbsp;- develop service projects as vehicles for recruitment
<br>&nbsp;- have projects that involve and support youth
<p>6. Develop a positive, recognizable image of Y'sdom in our communities.
<br>&nbsp;- greater involvement in our communities
<br>&nbsp;- collaborate with other community groups as partners
<br>&nbsp;- support regional and national projects with other clubs.
<br>&nbsp;- publicize during fundraising, how funds are used and where.
<br>&nbsp;- make better use of the media in all forms.
<br>&nbsp;- continue to work on improving two-way communications with your
local Y
<p>&nbsp;Most of these ideas are not new but may need a different approach
in implementation.
<br>We need to&nbsp; find the innovative clubs who have tried new ways
and are succeeding in building
<br>their club, in morale, in community recognition, in support from their
Y and ultimately in
<br>membership. If you have had success in any of these areas, let me know
and I will share your success with others.
