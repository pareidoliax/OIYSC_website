<br>We feel there are four aspects to our program that make us different
from many other service clubs.
<p><b>OPEN MEMBERSHIP:</b> Y Focus welcomes men and women of all ages,
of any race or religion. If you are an idealist who wants to help others,
we have a place for you.
<p><b>CHRISTIAN BASIS</b>: Like the YMCA, our movement is based on the
teachings of Jesus Christ which provide the framework and the direction
for our service, fellowship and our actions. We try to express our beliefs
in action, showing God?s love in our service to others.
<p><b>PARTNERSHIP WITH THE YMCA:</b> Our relationship with the YMCA is
unique among service clubs and will provide you with a wide range of local,
national and international opportunities for learning and participating.
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL FOCUS</b>: Your membership in the International Association
of Y Service Clubs will make you part of an international family whose
fellowship has to experienced to be believed. We have clubs in 72 countries,
filled with people working with the same idealism and common purpose.
<p>We believe that every member is important and valuable and we make every
attempt to give members the opportunity to contribute to the extent they
are able. Come visit us and find out for yourself!
