<br>As part of an international movement, Y FOCUS has a strong interest
in what goes on around the world. Our International theme is "Build a Culture
of Peace - Say No to Violence"&nbsp;
<p>a) International development.&nbsp;
<br>As our way of supporting the international development work of the
YMCA world-wide, our club raises funds through voluntary contributions
and a 24 Hour Fast held in February, the month when all clubs in the international
movement participate in the Time of Fast program. We encourage members
to fast and obtain sponsors or at least sponsor another member. The February
dinner meeting has an international development theme and at least two
other dinners are devoted to international topics as part of our attempt
to educate our members about international issues. Through Time of Fast
we have directly supported the partnership of the Ottawa-Carleton Y with
the Togo YMCA.&nbsp;
<p>b) The newest project is the importation and sale of Fair Trade Sports
Balls partly to raise funds for our projects in war-torn countries but
also to promote the principles of Fair Trade and draw attention to the
evil of child labour in industries such as hand stitched sports balls.
The Fair World Sports project&nbsp; is operated on behalf&nbsp; of all
Y Service clubs&nbsp; in Canada with sales made throughout Canada and into&nbsp;
the U.S. and&nbsp; other countries. A new project called "Let the Children
Play" collects used soccer balls and other sports equipment to send&nbsp;
with volunteers to children&nbsp; in&nbsp; poor and war affected&nbsp;
countries. For more information&nbsp; visit&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ncf.ca/yfocus/childsplay">www.ncf.ca/yfocus/childsplay&nbsp;&nbsp;</a>
<p>b) Brother Clubs.&nbsp;
<br>Y FOCUS maintains links with several clubs around the world, exchanging
bulletins, letters and visits. Occasionally we will join together in development
projects and we have the distinction of having sponsored the first club
in Sierra Leone, in Freetown. Another important partner club is Nairobi
South in Kenya.
<p>c) Youth Educational Exchange Program.&nbsp;
<br>Children of club members around the world can spend up to a year in
the home of a club member in another country. Over the years we have hosted
16 young people from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Kenya. At the
same time we have sent young people to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, India,
Australia and New Zealand. More emphasis is now being placed on the short
term program due to difficulties in placing students in schools.&nbsp;
<p>d) Short Term Exchange Program (STEP)&nbsp;
<br>This is an international exchange program where young people ages 14
- 25 years, from Y Service clubs or from the Y can spend up to 12 weeks
with a family in another country. Up to now we have hosted&nbsp; STEP students
from Finland, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan and Russia.&nbsp;
<p>e) Brotherhood Fund&nbsp;
<br>Club members are eligible to apply for grants to travel to conventions
or to visit other clubs in other countries. Most years we host an international
visitor travelling as a Brotherhood delegate. Club members host these international
visitors in their homes and we usually have a special meeting so that all
the club can meet the delegate. We raise money through personal donations
at meetings and through the sale of used stamps we collect. Each club must
contribute a minimum of $5 per member, per year, to have members eligible
for grants.&nbsp;
<p>f) Alexander Scholarship Fund&nbsp;
<br>Y Service Clubs in Canada provide annually, about 10 scholarships of
at least $500 to YMCA Canada for young people and Y staff for university
training or upgrading courses. We collect funds through a Booster Prize
raffle at the dinner meetings and through personal donations.&nbsp;
<p>g) Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone&nbsp;
<br>After the end of the civil war in Sierra Leone in 2000, there is now
a fragile peace that will need years of support. Through various programs
we try to raise&nbsp; much needed funds for the work of&nbsp; indigenous
Sierra Leone NGO's in their peace building work. To facilitate this work
the club founded a network called the <a href="http://www.ncf.ca/yfocus/sierraleone">Canadian
Friends of Sierra Leone,</a> working with the Sierra Leone Descendants
Union, interested churches and individuals. By the end of 2004, the network
had raised over $500 000 for peace building projects and the club continues
to support education and training projects there.
<p>g) George Jackson Youth Leadership Development Fund&nbsp;
<br>We work mainly through the Y in Ottawa and set up in the Y the George
Jackson Fund initially to assist international students who are studying
in Ottawa, especially those at Carleton University. The fund is a place
of last resort when all other sources have been exhausted. Funds are also
available to young Canadians for travel or study, to further their experience
in and understanding of international issues.&nbsp;</td>
