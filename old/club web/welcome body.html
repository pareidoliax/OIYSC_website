club usually meets&nbsp; monthly for dinner at the Metro Y, 180&nbsp; Argyla
Ave on the fourth Monday, at 6.00 p.m. There is a different theme each
month and usually we have a guest speaker with something interesting to
share that will help us in our work.&nbsp;
<br>The second&nbsp; Monday is usually a Planning or&nbsp; a Business Night,
usually at 7.00 p.m., to&nbsp; work on projects, conduct business, plan
for the future or discuss issues of special interest to the members. In
addition we will organize a day or&nbsp; weekend for a work party or other
special fund raising or service project.
<p><b>Our Mission</b> statement says that Y FOCUS is people working together,
using their time and talents,&nbsp;
<br>helping others develop their own resources and empowering them to take
control over their own lives.
<p><b>Our Service Goal</b> is to focus primarily on the needs and rights
of children while continuing to support
<br>the programs of our international movement, the National Capital Region
YMCA/YWCA and&nbsp;
<br>community groups who share similar goals and objectives.
<p>This web site gives you a lot of information about our club. If what
you read is what you are looking
<br>for, please join us at one of our meetings, to share our fellowship,
to offer service to your community
<br>and to enjoy personal growth and development.
