<a NAME="Phase2"></a><b><font size=+2>BUILDING A CULTURE OF PEACE IN SIERRA
LEONE</font></b>
<p><b>The Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone will implement the second phase
of their Culture of Peace project, entitled "PEACE THROUGH EDUCATION",
during 2003</b>, .
<p><b>BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS</b>
<br>As of January 2003, the focus of the "Culture of Peace" program will
shift to include major efforts to rebuild the primary education system
since most of the schools were dismantled or destroyed and the teachers
chased away by the rebels. In addition, peace building training will be
expanded to include more training in community organization so that the
communities will become more self sustaining and aware of their rights
and responsibilities and thus be better able to fight the root causes of
conflict, poverty, corruption, illiteracy, discrimination and unemployment.
Finally there will be a continued effort to alleviate poverty by supporting
community and business ventures that will increase the net income of the
population.
<p>Each Sierra Leone partner is developing projects in the 15 communities
where they are working. These projects will meet the specific needs of
that community as identified and supported by the members of that community.
The end result will be 15 strong, self reliant, well organized communities,
able to function effectively without relying on external aid.
<p><b>PROJECT SUMMARY</b>
<p>The term education is being interpreted in the widest possible way to
allow for many types of educational programs. The types of educational
activities would include the following:
<p>- citizens learning about their rights and responsibilities and how
make elected officials accountable for their actions.
<p>- citizens learning about the root causes of their war and about the
tools available for building and maintaining peace.
<p>- citizens learning how to organize and work together for the benefit
of their communities.
<p>- youth and adults learning to read and write and make appropriate decisions,
at a both a personal and community level.
<p>- young people learning a skill or trade that will lead to meaningful
employment and community participation.
<p>- women and youth learning the skills of operating a business and financial
management.
<p>- citizens learning about issues related to health, sanitation and environmental
protection.
<p><b>MAJOR PROGRAM COMPONENTS. </b>There are three primary areas of action.
<p><b>Primary Education: to rebuild the primary education system and combat
illiteracy.</b>
<p><b>- </b>primary schools refurbished, extended or built
<br>- furniture provided, built locally to provide employment.
<br>- supplies provided for sports, libraries and for students.
<br>- assistance for needy students ( financial support, school gardens
and lunches).
<br>- teacher assistance (training, strong parent-teachers groups, educational

<br>- support for peace educators in travelling to distant villages, dealing

<br>- community peace centres with multi purpose usage including space
for schools, adult education, community meetings, health clinics and recreational
activities.
<br>- peace promotion through dance, song, theatre and art.
<p><b>Business education: to expand business training and the provision

for up to 3000 families
<br>through individuals or groups

<p><b>Other possible areas for education work include:</b>
<p><b>Adult literacy </b>- For the general population and returning ex-combattants,
many of whom have missed several years of schooling and feel left out in
the regular system.
<p><b>Skills training </b>- for young people who have not been in school
during the civil war. (carpentry, brick making, construction, bicycle repair)
<p><b>Health and Sanitation - </b>increasing awareness and providing grants
to communities for community toilets and regular health clinics, including
AIDS awareness programs.
<p><b>Environmental protection -</b> increasing awareness of the problems
of clear cutting and supporting efforts such as reforestation projects
that include food bearing trees.
<p>There is a total of 15 communities with 60 villages or community groups
and&nbsp; there is now a base of&nbsp; 400+ trained volunteers active in
peace education, micro-credit work and community development. Should the
fund raising campaign be successful, other communities will be added in
coming years.
