<p><b><u>Fund raising event</u>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Sierra Leone Dinner and Auction.</u></b>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Location:</u> Lakeside Gardens, Brittania Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<u>Date:</u> Friday, April 5<sup>th</sup> 2002.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Over 200 people attended this event, emceed by Cecilia Haslett ,
of the Sierra Leone Descendants Union of Ottawa, and welcomed by the Honourable
Flora MacDonald&nbsp; Dinner was a wonderful buffet, provided&nbsp; by
Dave Smith and volunteer young people from several churches assisted in
waiting on the tables. Before and during the meal, guests were able to
view over 120&nbsp; silent auction items and enjoy background music from
D.J.&nbsp; Robert Kruikemeijer, a Sierra Leone born Canadian who donated
his services.</b>
<br><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After dinner young members of the SLDU presented
some dance numbers to Sierra Leone music and Noumousso Kone, SLDU President,
expressed thanks to all who helped with the event. Dave Smith carried on
the Live Auction and managed to extract a few thousand dollars from a rather
parsimonious crowd. Those who were still standing after the auction stayed
to dance until the end. With a profit of between $10 000 and $11 000, the
event was a success but it was even more of a success&nbsp; in terms of
building a feeling of community between the various groups who came together
to carry out the event.</b><b></b>
<p><b>Much thanks goes out to members of the constituent groups of CFSL,
Ottawa Monthly Meeting, Bells Corners United Church, Northwestern United
Church, Ottawa Unitarian Church, Sierra Leone Descendants Union, Y FOCUS
- Ottawa,&nbsp; Peacefund Canada and the Canadian Friends Service Committee.</b>
