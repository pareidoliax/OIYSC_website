<p><b>Thanks to major funding from the CIDA Peacebuilding Unit and the
Canadian Auto Workers Union, we have been able to fund projects aimed at
building the peace, providing emergency assistance and supporting small
business through micro credit.</b> <b>The project started in January 2001
and has the following components</b>:
<p><b>Project objectives.</b>
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot;</font> improve the lives of community members

<p><font face="Symbol">&middot;</font> increase awareness of community
conditions, needs, attitudes, feasible strategies and options to be developed
towards building peace from the community level
<p><font face="Symbol">&middot;</font> build capacity within communities
and within and among NGOs to plan and carry out activities and programmes
for the well-being of all community members.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The main activities.</b>

and non-food items) to those most in need, who have difficulty accessing
other sources of assistance

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Program Update.</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In July of 2002, David Bruer, Executive
Director of Peacefund Canada, and David Hall of Y FOCUS-Ottawa, representing
Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone (CFSL), visited several projects around
Sierra Leone. The purpose of the trip was to gather information, firstly
for a report to CIDA due in October and secondly for promotion of the project
in future fund raising as we seek to expand the program, building on the
good success of the first two years. A full report on the visit and the
progress in the Culture of Peace program is now available.</font>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The three S.L. Partners have identified
15 chiefdoms and communities which they consider most damaged by the war
and with high numbers of the most vulnerable people, such as widows and
single mothers, displaced persons, returning ex-combatants (especially
young people) and farmers coming back from refugee camps in Guinea and
Liberia. In the first 18 months they focused on</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">a) providing emergency aid such as seeds,
tools and household utensils to displaced persons and returning farmers.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">b) training of over 400 peace educators
who are now active in their communities in settling family and land disputes,
in helping ex-combattants return to their communities and in trauma healing.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman">c) providing small loans to individuals
and community groups to start small enterprises and generate income.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Building on the success of the present
initiatives, CFSL and its Sierra Leone Partners have now developed proposals
for the continuation and expansion of the work, to take advantage of the
network of trained people now in place. There will be an added focus on
rebuilding primary education in the country since this has been identified
as the next priority in the maintenance of a lasting peace.</font>
