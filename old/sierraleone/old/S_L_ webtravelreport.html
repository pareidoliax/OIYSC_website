<p><b><font size=+2>CULTURE OF PEACE PROJECT</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+2>&nbsp;CANADIAN PARTNERS VISIT SIERRA LEONE</font></b>
<br><b><font size=+2>May 2001</font></b></center>

<p>Gianne Broughton,of the Canadian Friends Service Committee and Nancy
Drozd, of Peacefund Canada, on behalf of the Canadian Friends of Sierra
Leone (CFSL)<b>, </b>visited Sierra Leone from April 30 to May 10<sup>th</sup>,
2001 The visit provided a great opportunity for Canadian and Sierra Leonean
partners to meet in Freetown (the first of three visits during the course
of the project) and explore ways to strengthen the partnership and the
project.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>The day after their arrival, on <b>Thursday, May 3<sup>rd</sup></b>,
Gianne and Nancy met with the three Sierra Leone partners for review of
the overall project and then met with two of the partners, first the YMCA
and the Freetown Y Service Club and then the Sierra Leone Council of Churches.
<p>The YMCA owns a modest three story building located in downtown Freetown.
There is a cafeteria that serves affordable daily lunch and dinner specials.
Twelve or so beds provide accommodation for travelers on the second floor,
and a host of offices and meetings rooms are on the main floor. The third
floor is an open gathering space with a roof but no windows, and this is
where the training sessions were held.
<p>Nancy and Gianne met with senior staff members of the YMCA for about
an hour and talked about the history of the YMCA in Sierra Leone, the current
political situation in the country and the relationship between the Y Service
Club, the YMCA and the YWCA.
<p>The activities of the YMCA and the Y Service Club are essentially the
same. They support each other. In terms of the Culture of Peace Program,
it is jointly run with an ad hoc committee including an equal number of
members from each group. The YMCA and the YWCA operate independently although
once a year they co-organize a "week of prayer" plus there is a women's
wing of the YMCA that has some connection with the YWCA. YMCA activities
include an agricultural program, skills training program (carpentry, brick
making, soap making, etc) and peace education program. Their focus is mainly
on youth, considered to be 35 or younger. The other partners direct their
youth to the YMCA and they estimate that 95% of the rebels who invaded
Freetown on January 6, 1999 were youth.
<p>The living conditions in Freetown are very poor. They estimate that
within the past few years and particularly after the invasion of 1999 the
population of Freetown has more than doubled to 1.5 million. Whereas 2-3
people would share a room to sleep, now there are 6-7 sharing space in
private houses. The government has not helped to rebuild houses in Freetown.
You can look in any direction from the top floor of the building and see
destruction. At the same time, people are doing what they can to rebuild.
The YMCA's current focus is to help rebuild the lives of Freetowners through
peace education and skills training.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Council of Churches of Sierra Leone is the oldest and largest NGO,
in terms of staff, in Sierra Leone and is considered unique in that it
partners with local NGOs Their programs are "people oriented"and touch
on almost everything including agriculture, management of internally displaced
persons, construction of roads and bridges, HIV prevention, psycho-social
programs, legal issues and representation in court, small arms, civic education,
national and international networking, gender issues, conflict diamonds,
scholarships, etc. "Peace building is bits and pieces of everything we
do". They reported on their involvement in the second phase of the Partnership
Africa Canada project which involved the management of the micro-projects
fund. "Economic empowerment will help achieve peace". When asked about
their owns needs, they responded that in terms of capacity building they
would benefit from skills training in report writing, proposal writing
and access to short-term (one-two week training sessions) on management
training.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>On Friday</b>, Nancy and Gianne observed some YMCA peace education
training of trainers.
<p>They were introduced to the 70 or so 'trainers in training' and then
observed the session from the back of the class. There was a very good
gender balance and a range of ages. This training session was part of the
second phase of the Culture of Peace Project in Zone B in Freetown. Training
for Zone A took place the previous week.. Phase One of this program involved
selecting the trainers to do the Training of Trainers sessions and to find
the participants to attend. Each participant is given an honorarium and
free lunches.
<p>The trainers were very successful in keeping the trainees engaged. during
the whole session with frequent passionate outbursts, questions, discussion
and laughter.
<p>Then came a trip to Bo. The highway to Bo is paved for the first 20
miles and then its dirt and craters for the remaining five hour journey.
The NMJD's best vehicle was used, a jeep with a covered back which would
snugly seat three people on each bench. The drive should have only taken
about 2 hours but the road is in such bad shape that it took over twice
as long. NMJD staffer, Paul, told stories about the villages we passed
and how many times they were attacked over the years. He told of how some
were once thriving villages and now only a few families have found the
courage and means to return.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>On Saturday, May 5</b>, there was a visit to Daasamu to observe a
community session on peace education. Five villages in the community of
Semobu Folobu have benefitted from the training of trainers programs and
leaders from these five villages participated in a Training of Trainers
program hosted by NMJD. They invited the visitors to enter their community,
to meet with them, to witness their living conditions first hand and to
see how the villagers have responded to the lessons and messages brought
to them by the trainers.
<p>The visitors arrived, after a long bumpy ride, where the road ended,
at the outskirts of the village. The villagers came running to meet them,
led by members of the Kamajor, and they escorted everyone to the village
gathering area which they had built for the occasion. There was an hour
of introductions (with interpretation) and the Canadians made their own
welcoming remarks. Presentations were given by various members of the community
and by NMJD staff. These presentations touched on the serious issues they
face. One issue in particular is the reintegration of ex-combatants and
They addressed the concerns of trust and forgiveness with questions like
"How do we let the ex-combatants know that they would be accepted back
into the communities?" "How can we trust them and how can they trust us
not to seek revenge?"
<p>The Kamajors spoke, the women leaders spoke, the elders spoke. Then
there was a role play of a trial, including confessions, forgiveness and
reconciliation, followed by a ceremonial libation. And finally there was
singing, dancing, comedy, an acrobat and a lunch of wild game and rice.
<p>Later that day, Nancy and Gianne visited an Internally Displaced Persons
Camp (Jembeh), about an hour's drive on a good road south of Bo. They met
with the Chairman who toured them through the camp and answered a steady
flow of questions from the group. He had intended to be an automotive mechanic
back in his village in the Northern Area, but for the past 10 years has
been running from the rebels, and from one IDP camp to another. Before
he helped establish this camp, he was in Guinea for a couple of years.
The visitors were impressed at how well managed the camp seemed, including
supplies, health services, sanitation and space per household. He knows
all the families by name and the exact number of displaced persons.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>On Monday</b>, Nancy, Gianne were back in Freetown and, with some
of the Sierra Leone partners, met with representatives of CAUSE Canada<b>.</b>
CAUSE is on contract with the High Commission in Conakry to manage the
Canada Fund and its budget of approx $500,000, receives about 300 requests
per year and approves about 9. The High Commissioner makes final decision
on all grants that are recommended by CAUSE , in line with the annual set
of priorities
<p>CAUSE started its programming in 1988 and focused on primary health
care. They continue to focus on health (physical and psycho-social) doing
rehabilitation with amputees and war wounded. They have a Peacebuilding
Fund grant to work with ex-child combatants providing education and skills
training.
<p>In terms of capacity building, they suggest they could use case workers
from abroad who can address the "taboo" issue of rape and other women-specific
issues resulting from the war. "Using a gun is forgivable, but not some
of these other acts of atrocities". Other capacity building needs include:
special needs for war wounded, amputee reintegration, early warning techniques,
conflict prevention and mitigation. They see value in having someone from
another war-torn country come and share their experiences.
<p>Next the group visited the Grafton and Waterloo IDP Camps. The route
to Grafton camp took them through the eastern part of Freetown where they
saw the extent of the destruction as they slowly crawled through the crowded,
narrow, and pot-holed dirt roads. There are bullet holes in many of the
remaining buildings and even some of the churches were burned down.
<p>Grafton camp is located five km outside of Freetown and the population
is approx 16,000 (official), 20,000 (unofficial). There are separate sections
for war wounded and for amputees. 60 of the 480 sheds were built by the
Canada Fund. Some IDPs have been here for 10 years -- some have attempted
to return home but did not succeed because of renewed attacks. Some first
escaped to Guinea, lived in a camp there for years, then were moved here.
<p>Approx. 1/3 of the IDPs have a small source of income (mainly cutting
wood from the forest and selling it in town -- environmentalists are very
concerned about erosion). About 4,000 IDPs are homeless Freetowners from
the eastern part for the city. As the visitors met with the Chairman of
the camp on his front porch, just behind their heads they could hear the
rats running between the UNHCR plastic sheets and the mud walls. The camp
is a very depressing site. The houses are falling apart, there are no gardens
because there are no seeds, and health services provided by Medecins Sans
Frontieres and Red Cross are very limited. Some children manage to go to
schools in town, but most others rely on the volunteer teachers in the
camps who teach without supplies. Many of the children show signs of malnourishment
and at the time of the visit the camp had not received their food rations
for over two months.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>On Tuesday, May 8</b>, Nancy and Gianne participated in opening of
CCSL peace education, training of trainers workshop. This session was similar
to the session at the YMCA. Each S.L. partner does its own training program
on peace education. There were approx 20-25 participants including nurses,
pastors and teachers, seven of whom were women, and the facilitation was
excellent. This particular workshop was supposed to be held in Makeni but
could not because of the political instability.
<p>Later that day, the Canadians met with representatives of the National
Movement for Justice and Development, the NMJD. Each staff member introduced
themselves and the programs that they coordinate which include gender,
program participatory approaches, community animation, peace building,
administration and finances . Their geographic scope is very broad, reaching
most of the southern half of the country. The northern parts are still
"no-go" zones but CCSL has links in that region.
<p>One staff person Nancy and Gianne met was Anita, a community animator.
She helps to strengthen community groups in the eastern area of Freetown
and through these groups, she has access to the people. She is working
on developing proper sanitation (building toilets) in an area that was
almost totally destroyed during the invasion. She is also doing peace building
work, particularly among youth, and work on the issue of tribalism. She
has organized football tournaments which include 10 teams, some of which
are all female. Some of her funding comes from Canadian Feed the Children.
The Canadians spent some time training the staff to use the digital camera
and also downloaded a virus scan which they had brought.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>On Wednesday, May 9<sup>th</sup>, Nancy and Gianne held a final meeting
with the Sierra Leonean Partners before catching a helicopter to the airport
for the long flight home.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><b>CONCLUSION.</b>
<br>As Nancy and Gianne concluded in their trip report, "We are confident
in our Sierra Leonean partners. They are fully competent to carry out the
project, both in organization and administration skills, as well as the
capacities needed to interact with community people to meet the project
objectives. We feel there is no need to be checking and supervising to
keep the project going. What has already been done has resulted in processes
that will have a life of their own, and every additional bit of work will
only add effectiveness.
<p>It was also a pleasure to watch the trainers interact with the trainees,
and to observe the work of the NMJD community animators on our visits to
Semobu Folobu and the Jembeh camp.
<p>The partners are very keen to find ways to generate income on an ongoing
basis, in addition to international funding. One idea is to collaborate
in building a guest-house for international travelers.
<p>We need to look at ways to incorporate issues relating to rape, sex
slavery, and other atrocities experienced by women. The issue of reconciliation
and reintegration of RUF soldiers is very tricky and there is a lot of
doubt that this is actually possible. We did not see or hear of any examples
of this happening. Some Sierra Leonians think that it will take as long
as another generation after the fighting ends and after people return home,
before life may return to some kind of normalcy".
