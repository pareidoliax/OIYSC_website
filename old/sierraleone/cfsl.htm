<h4>
Visit during May 2001</h4></center>
<span class="paragraphStarter">G</span>ianne Broughton and Nancy Drozd
of CFSL visited our partners in Sierra Leone in early May, 2001. Here is
Gianne's report of her impressions of some of the training programs they
visited. An edited version of the <a href="webtravelreport.htm" class="reg">trip
report </a>is also available for your information.&nbsp;

<h5>
Sierra Leonean Organizations Building a Culture of Peace</h5></center>

<div style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight:bold; color:#990000;">
<div align=right>from Gianne Broughton&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<p><br><span class="paragraphStarter">I</span>n early May, 2001, Nancy
Drozd and I observed culture-building in process first hand. Using an impressive
toolkit of inter-personal communication skills with flare and art, project
workers provoked and cajoled and listened as people analysed their own
experience, began to understand alternatives, and came to believe that
they could build peace. In the first stage, a group of about 20 men and
women learn how to train community peace workers. We saw the opening day
of training at the Council of Churches of Sierra Leone for people from
the Makeni area in the northern region of the country that was still under
rebel control. Three pairs of participants volunteered to try to push each
other to opposite sides of the room: kind of a full-body arm-wrestling
match. Amid laughter and grimaces of effort, participants observed their
own responses too this controlled mini-conflict. Then, the facilitator
lead people in an analysis of their responses and invited discussion of
how they had seen similar responses in the life-and-death conflicts of
their recent history. Everyone present could relate personal stories of
how bloodshed was avoided or stopped. This group had four more days ahead
of them in which they would learn skills in conflict analysis and resolution,
trauma healing, community animation, and, most importantly, how to teach
these skills to others.&nbsp;
<p><span class="paragraphStarter">I</span>n In the second stage, which
we observed for a group from Freetown at the YMCA, members from the original
group of twenty had gone out and recruited 72 formal and informal community
leaders from two neighbouring areas of the city by talking with people
about who they go to for advice and assistance, or who they know is doing
something for the community. These 72 were then trained by members of the
original group using similar techniques and a curriculum that they had
worked out in the first stage.&nbsp;
<p><span class="paragraphStarter">F</span>inally, in the third stage, these
community leaders use their new or strengthened community animation skills
to organise events and activities to include the whole community so that
the conflicts and challenges facing the community can be discussed openly.
We were able to see one such event organised by project trainees in a rural
community near Bo, Semobu Folobu. With the help of a role-play, members
of all segments of the community, including the civil militia (called "kamajors")
who have a traditional role in Sierra Leone culture, discussed how disarmed
rebels could be received back into the community. This seemed to be the
primary challenge to further progress in the peace process. The rebels
would not disarm and disband while they were certain that they would be
retaliated against if they left the "bush" and returned to a settled life.
For me, the role of war-time atrocities as a strategy for ensuring that
a society remains in turmoil, was unmasked by this discussion. Traditional
judicial processes were depicted, and a traditional libation ceremony and
communal meal were also part of the day's activities. The sense we had
of a community ready to face its future in a common search for peace was
celebrated by traditional singing and dancing at the end of the day.&nbsp;<!--
