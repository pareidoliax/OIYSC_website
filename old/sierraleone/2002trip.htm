		<h3>Sierra Leone on the Move</h3>
		</div>
		<div style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight:bold; color:#990000;" align="right">
		from David Hall, Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone
		</div>
		<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">M</span>y 
		overall impression of my first visit to Sierra Leone in July 2002,
		was of people on the move, usually on foot, dodging through the crowded
		streets of Freetown, striding along the largely deserted highways between
		towns and cities, trudging along between villages on dirt tracks barely
		wide enough for a small car. There seemed to be constant motion with street
		pedlars loaded down with their wares looking for that customer who
		will buy and guarantee at least one meal for the day. Women with
		small children in tow, leave home to gather firewood and water, consuming
		hours of time in search of these basic necessities and carrying them home.
		Students walk to school, rain or shine, in small groups according to their
		school uniform. They often travel long distances because the school closest
		to them is already overcrowded, with as many as 80 students to a class. There 
		are farmers, men and women both, who enter the city early each morning,
		with large baskets on their head, hoping that when they return home the
		baskets will be empty and they will have instead a few leones to survive
		a few more days. I remember vividly being taken by a woman farmer, deep
		into the bush until the pathway disappeared under the water of a flooded
		swamp. There she proudly showed me the small area of swamp rice she carefully
		tended, using rice seed loaned to get her started again. Then we walked
		back to the road and she continued walking back to her home in a nearby
		town, along a route she would follow almost daily until the rice was harvested.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">P</span>oeple 
		are on the move fighting for survival and peace, but with
		a hope and energy that is surprising given the brief period since peace
		was officially declared in the January before. Since that time, the people
		of Sierra Leone had seen that last of the rebels disarm opr leave for nearby
		Liberia,. They had experienced a successful and largely trouble-free national
		election which returned President Kabbah with a large majority in parliament.
		The talk was of restored jobs in the mining industry and even of future
		development of oil offshore. But above all people spoke to me of their absolute 
		commitment to make sure war would not come again to Sierra Leone.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>his 
		commitment to peace meant that communities and individuals were
		prepared to do what was necessary to ensure peace and the groups we were
		working with in Sierra Leone were on the front line organizing and training
		for that that peaceful future. I heard personal accounts from peace educators
		in Kenema, trained by the Network Movement for Justice and Development
		and involved in the reconciliation between communities and families
		and returning ex-combattants, some of whom had committed unspeakable
		atrocities against their own people. Farmers returning from refugee
		camps in Liberia went back to their overgrown fields in Tiama and with
		the loan of seed rice from the YMCA and Y Service Club, grew enough rice
		to return 95% of the original amount for use by another 80 farmers. At
		the same time they produced enough rice for their own seed needs,
		for food and even had some to sell at the market. In one northern
		community the women joked about how much weight the had put on since starting
		their small business and generating enough income for food, using small	loans 
		from the Council of Churches of Sierra Leone. Wherever we went
		we met groups and individuals determined to move ahead in their rebuilding,
		with or without help from the developed countries.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">I</span> was 
		in Sierra Leone with David Bruer, the Executive Director of
		Peacefund Canada which serves as the lead agency for a network supporting
		the people of Sierra Leone, the Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone. We are
		a collection of NGO's, churches and groups based in Ottawa supporting
		a Culture of Peace program carried out by our three Sierra Leone Partners.
		We had reports to write for major financial supporters and wanted to meet
		the people behind the e-mail addresses as well as gather information for
		future fund raising and possible program expansion. Meeting the staff and
		volunteers of the three organizations just confirmed my impression of people
		on the move, crisscrossing the counrty, visiting remore villages, entering
		displaced persons camps, bringing the message of reconciliation, peace
		building and hope.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">I</span>n 
		the fifteen chiefdoms and communities where our partners work,
		more than 400 trained peace educators are active, settling land and family
		disputes, easing the acceptance of returning child soldiers and in the
		process, challenging the authority of the chiefs to impose crippling fines,
		especially on young people involved in community conflicts. Many people
		suggested that these impossible fines drove young people out of their communities,
		providing a ready pool of disaffected youth for recruitment by the rebels.
		In the Northern Province, women are being targeted by the CCSL for micro-credit
		initiatives and training in business practices and financial management.
		Then with about $50 CDN as a loan, they can begin to generate income, enough
		to feed their families, cover school fees and pay for medical help.
		Within a relatively short time, they are able to repay their loans, freeing
		up the funds for other women to get started. In the south, NMJD takes
		a slightly different approach to income generation, by providing grants
		to communities and groups, to build facilities such as storage sheds for
		crops or drying floors that will reduce waste and spoilage, leaving more
		food for selling in the nearest market.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>hroughout 
		our travels, in each community we visited, there was a
		"palaver", a community meeting where everyone in the community was able
		to say their piece. As representatives of a rich country we were
		seated as dignitaries at the "High Table", entertained by dancers and singers,
		praised and thanked for all we had contributed. But we also heard from
		primary students, village elders, peace educators, women in business and
		even a dance theater instructor that the journey towards a lasting peace
		was only just beginning. The people were anxious to move further and faster
		and pointed out how we could help them in the rebuilding, especially of
		civil society.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he 
		peace educators asked for help in spreading their message further
		through the use of bicycles and raincoats and suggested the need for Peace
		Centres in many villages which could also be used as community meeting
		places, for recreation, health clinics and even for primary schooling.
		In Makari, the women reminded us that there were 50 other widows
		in their community, with no steady source of income and who needed
		help to overcome their poverty. In places like Tissoh, I met with
		teachers, some unpaid and ill trained, in primary schools where students
		had either no furniture or with rudimentary benches and desks since most
		had been taken for fuel by the rebels. $30 CDN will cover the cost of primary
		education for one child, for a year, including, fees, uniform, books and
		supplies. Yet this is a big burden for families who will be fortunate to
		earn $100-200 a year and takes away income needed to move beyond
		mere survival.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he 
		people of Sierra Leone are not waiting for help from the developed
		world, they are moving ahead, albeit slowly and with difficulty. Such perseverance
		and resilience deserves our support. Though the war is over and Sierra
		Leone has faded from the daily headlines, the effects of almost 10 years
		of civil war will take much time and effort to overcome. The Candain
		Friends of Sierra Leone, working with our Sierra Leone Partners, is one
		vehicle through which Canadians can reach out and show their support and
		solidarity. We plan to continue and even expand our efforts to include
		rebuilding the primary education system in the 15 communities where we
		have a solid base of organized community groups, peace educators
		and micro-credit beneficiaries. We have come too far to stop now and our
		goal must be to build these communities to a level of strength and self-reliance
		that will ensure their success long after the aid agencies have moved on
		to the newest world hotspot.
