		<h3>Culture of Peace Project May 2001</h3>
		</div>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">G</span>ianne 
		Broughton,of the Canadian Friends Service Committee and Nancy
		Drozd, of Peacefund Canada, on behalf of the Canadian Friends of Sierra
		Leone (CFSL), visited Sierra Leone from April 30 to May 10<sup>th</sup>,
		2001 The visit provided a great opportunity for Canadian and Sierra Leonean
		partners to meet in Freetown (the first of three visits during the course
		of the project) and explore ways to strengthen the partnership and the
		project.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he 
		day after their arrival, on <b>Thursday, May 3<sup>rd</sup></b>,
		Gianne and Nancy met with the three Sierra Leone partners for review of
		the overall project and then met with two of the partners, first the YMCA
		and the Freetown Y Service Club and then the Sierra Leone Council of Churches.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he
		YMCA owns a modest three story building located in downtown Freetown.
		There is a cafeteria that serves affordable daily lunch and dinner specials.
		Twelve or so beds provide accommodation for travelers on the second floor,
		and a host of offices and meetings rooms are on the main floor. The third
		floor is an open gathering space with a roof but no windows, and this is
		where the training sessions were held.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">N</span>ancy 
		and Gianne met with senior staff members of the YMCA for about
		an hour and talked about the history of the YMCA in Sierra Leone, the current
		political situation in the country and the relationship between the Y Service
		Club, the YMCA and the YWCA.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he 
		activities of the YMCA and the Y Service Club are essentially the
		same. They support each other. In terms of the Culture of Peace Program,
		it is jointly run with an ad hoc committee including an equal number of
		members from each group. The YMCA and the YWCA operate independently although
		once a year they co-organize a "week of prayer" plus there is a women's
		wing of the YMCA that has some connection with the YWCA. YMCA activities
		include an agricultural program, skills training program (carpentry, brick
		making, soap making, etc) and peace education program. Their focus is mainly
		on youth, considered to be 35 or younger. The other partners direct their
		youth to the YMCA and they estimate that 95% of the rebels who invaded
		Freetown on January 6, 1999 were youth.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he
		living conditions in Freetown are very poor. They estimate that
		within the past few years and particularly after the invasion of 1999 the
		population of Freetown has more than doubled to 1.5 million. Whereas 2-3
		people would share a room to sleep, now there are 6-7 sharing space in
		private houses. The government has not helped to rebuild houses in Freetown.
		You can look in any direction from the top floor of the building and see
		destruction. At the same time, people are doing what they can to rebuild.
		The YMCA's current focus is to help rebuild the lives of Freetowners through
		peace education and skills training.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he 
		Council of Churches of Sierra Leone is the oldest and largest NGO,
		in terms of staff, in Sierra Leone and is considered unique in that it
		partners with local NGOs Their programs are "people oriented"and touch
		on almost everything including agriculture, management of internally displaced
		persons, construction of roads and bridges, HIV prevention, psycho-social
		programs, legal issues and representation in court, small arms, civic education,
		national and international networking, gender issues, conflict diamonds,
		scholarships, etc. "Peace building is bits and pieces of everything we
		do". They reported on their involvement in the second phase of the Partnership
		Africa Canada project which involved the management of the micro-projects
		fund. "Economic empowerment will help achieve peace". When asked about
		their owns needs, they responded that in terms of capacity building they
		would benefit from skills training in report writing, proposal writing
		and access to short-term (one-two week training sessions) on management
		training.

		<h4>On Friday, May 4<sup>th</sup></h4>
		</div>
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">N</span>ancy 
		and Gianne observed some YMCA peace education
		training of trainers.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>hey 
		were introduced to the 70 or so 'trainers in training' and then
		observed the session from the back of the class. There was a very good
		gender balance and a range of ages. This training session was part of the
		second phase of the Culture of Peace Project in Zone B in Freetown. Training
		for Zone A took place the previous week.. Phase One of this program involved
		selecting the trainers to do the Training of Trainers sessions and to find
		the participants to attend. Each participant is given an honorarium and
		free lunches.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he
		trainers were very successful in keeping the trainees engaged. during
		the whole session with frequent passionate outbursts, questions, discussion
		and laughter.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>hen
		came a trip to Bo. The highway to Bo is paved for the first 20
		miles and then its dirt and craters for the remaining five hour journey.
		The NMJD's best vehicle was used, a jeep with a covered back which would
		snugly seat three people on each bench. The drive should have only taken
		about 2 hours but the road is in such bad shape that it took over twice
		as long. NMJD staffer, Paul, told stories about the villages we passed
		and how many times they were attacked over the years. He told of how some
		were once thriving villages and now only a few families have found the
		courage and means to return.

		<br><br>
		<div align="center">
		<h4>On Saturday, May 5<sup>th</sup></h4>
		</div>
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>here 
		was a visit to Daasamu to observe a
		community session on peace education. Five villages in the community of
		Semobu Folobu have benefitted from the training of trainers programs and
		leaders from these five villages participated in a Training of Trainers
		program hosted by NMJD. They invited the visitors to enter their community,
		to meet with them, to witness their living conditions first hand and to
		see how the villagers have responded to the lessons and messages brought
		to them by the trainers.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he
		visitors arrived, after a long bumpy ride, where the road ended,
		at the outskirts of the village. The villagers came running to meet them,
		led by members of the Kamajor, and they escorted everyone to the village
		gathering area which they had built for the occasion. There was an hour
		of introductions (with interpretation) and the Canadians made their own
		welcoming remarks. Presentations were given by various members of the community
		and by NMJD staff. These presentations touched on the serious issues they
		face. One issue in particular is the reintegration of ex-combatants and
		They addressed the concerns of trust and forgiveness with questions like
		"How do we let the ex-combatants know that they would be accepted back
		into the communities?" "How can we trust them and how can they trust us
		not to seek revenge?"
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he
		Kamajors spoke, the women leaders spoke, the elders spoke. Then
		there was a role play of a trial, including confessions, forgiveness and
		reconciliation, followed by a ceremonial libation. And finally there was
		singing, dancing, comedy, an acrobat and a lunch of wild game and rice.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">L</span>ater
		that day, Nancy and Gianne visited an Internally Displaced Persons
		Camp (Jembeh), about an hour's drive on a good road south of Bo. They met
		with the Chairman who toured them through the camp and answered a steady
		flow of questions from the group. He had intended to be an automotive mechanic
		back in his village in the Northern Area, but for the past 10 years has
		been running from the rebels, and from one IDP camp to another. Before
		he helped establish this camp, he was in Guinea for a couple of years.
		The visitors were impressed at how well managed the camp seemed, including
		supplies, health services, sanitation and space per household. He knows
		all the families by name and the exact number of displaced persons.

		<h4>On Monday, May 7<sup>th</sup></h4>
		</div>
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">N</span>ancy, 
		Gianne were back in Freetown and, with some
		of the Sierra Leone partners, met with representatives of CAUSE Canada<b>.</b>
		CAUSE is on contract with the High Commission in Conakry to manage the
		Canada Fund and its budget of approx $500,000, receives about 300 requests
		per year and approves about 9. The High Commissioner makes final decision
		on all grants that are recommended by CAUSE , in line with the annual set
		of priorities

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">C</span>ause 
		started its programming in 1988 and focused on primary health
		care. They continue to focus on health (physical and psycho-social) doing
		rehabilitation with amputees and war wounded. They have a Peacebuilding
		Fund grant to work with ex-child combatants providing education and skills
		training.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">I</span>n 
		terms of capacity building, they suggest they could use case workers
		from abroad who can address the "taboo" issue of rape and other women-specific
		issues resulting from the war. "Using a gun is forgivable, but not some
		of these other acts of atrocities". Other capacity building needs include:
		special needs for war wounded, amputee reintegration, early warning techniques,
		conflict prevention and mitigation. They see value in having someone from
		another war-torn country come and share their experiences.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">N</span>ext 
		the group visited the Grafton and Waterloo IDP Camps. The route
		to Grafton camp took them through the eastern part of Freetown where they
		saw the extent of the destruction as they slowly crawled through the crowded,
		narrow, and pot-holed dirt roads. There are bullet holes in many of the
		remaining buildings and even some of the churches were burned down.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">G</span>rafton 
		camp is located five km outside of Freetown and the population
		is approx 16,000 (official), 20,000 (unofficial). There are separate sections
		for war wounded and for amputees. 60 of the 480 sheds were built by the
		Canada Fund. Some IDPs have been here for 10 years -- some have attempted
		to return home but did not succeed because of renewed attacks. Some first
		escaped to Guinea, lived in a camp there for years, then were moved here.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">A</span>
		pprox. 1/3 of the IDPs have a small source of income (mainly cutting
		wood from the forest and selling it in town -- environmentalists are very
		concerned about erosion). About 4,000 IDPs are homeless Freetowners from
		the eastern part for the city. As the visitors met with the Chairman of
		the camp on his front porch, just behind their heads they could hear the
		rats running between the UNHCR plastic sheets and the mud walls. The camp
		is a very depressing site. The houses are falling apart, there are no gardens
		because there are no seeds, and health services provided by Medecins Sans
		Frontieres and Red Cross are very limited. Some children manage to go to
		schools in town, but most others rely on the volunteer teachers in the
		camps who teach without supplies. Many of the children show signs of malnourishment
		and at the time of the visit the camp had not received their food rations
		for over two months.

		<h4>On Tuesday, May 8<sup>th</sup></h4>
		</div>

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">N</span>ancy 
		and Gianne participated in opening of
		CCSL peace education, training of trainers workshop. This session was similar
		to the session at the YMCA. Each S.L. partner does its own training program
		on peace education. There were approx 20-25 participants including nurses,
		pastors and teachers, seven of whom were women, and the facilitation was
		excellent. This particular workshop was supposed to be held in Makeni but
		could not because of the political instability.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">L</span>ater 
		that day, the Canadians met with representatives of the National
		Movement for Justice and Development, the NMJD. Each staff member introduced
		themselves and the programs that they coordinate which include gender,
		program participatory approaches, community animation, peace building,
		administration and finances . Their geographic scope is very broad, reaching
		most of the southern half of the country. The northern parts are still
		"no-go" zones but CCSL has links in that region.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">O</span>ne 
		staff person Nancy and Gianne met was Anita, a community animator.
		She helps to strengthen community groups in the eastern area of Freetown
		and through these groups, she has access to the people. She is working
		on developing proper sanitation (building toilets) in an area that was
		almost totally destroyed during the invasion. She is also doing peace building
		work, particularly among youth, and work on the issue of tribalism. She
		has organized football tournaments which include 10 teams, some of which
		are all female. Some of her funding comes from Canadian Feed the Children.
		The Canadians spent some time training the staff to use the digital camera
		and also downloaded a virus scan which they had brought.

		<div align="center">
		<h4>On Wednesday, May 9<sup>th</sup></h4>
		</div>
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">N</span>ancy 
		Nancy and Gianne held a final meeting
		with the Sierra Leonean Partners before catching a helicopter to the airport
		for the long flight home.


		<br><br>
		<br><br>
		<div align="center">
		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		</div>
	
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">A</span>s
		As Nancy and Gianne concluded in their trip report, &quot;We are confident
		in our Sierra Leonean partners. They are fully competent to carry out the
		project, both in organization and administration skills, as well as the
		capacities needed to interact with community people to meet the project
		objectives. We feel there is no need to be checking and supervising to
		keep the project going. What has already been done has resulted in processes
		that will have a life of their own, and every additional bit of work will
		only add effectiveness.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">I</span>t
		was also a pleasure to watch the trainers interact with the trainees,
		and to observe the work of the NMJD community animators on our visits to
		Semobu Folobu and the Jembeh camp.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">T</span>he
		The partners are very keen to find ways to generate income on an ongoing
		basis, in addition to international funding. One idea is to collaborate
		in building a guest-house for international travelers.
		
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="paragraphStarter">W</span>e
		need to look at ways to incorporate issues relating to rape, sex
		slavery, and other atrocities experienced by women. The issue of reconciliation
		and reintegration of RUF soldiers is very tricky and there is a lot of
		doubt that this is actually possible. We did not see or hear of any examples
		of this happening. Some Sierra Leonians think that it will take as long
		as another generation after the fighting ends and after people return home,
		before life may return to some kind of normalcy&quot;.
