<br>As part of an international movement, Y FOCUS has a strong interest
in what goes on around the
<br>world.&nbsp; Our current International theme is "Build a Culture of
Peace - Say No to Violence"
<p>a) International development.
<br>As our way of supporting the international development work of the
YMCA world-wide, our club raises
<br>funds through voluntary contributions and a 24 Hour Fast held in February.
This is the month when all&nbsp;
<br>clubs in Y'sdom International celebrate a Time of Fast. We encourage
all members to fast and obtain&nbsp;
<br>sponsors or at least sponsor another member. The February dinner meeting
has an international&nbsp;
<br>development theme and at least two other dinners are devoted to international
topics as part of our&nbsp;
<br>attempt to educate our members about international issues. Through
Time of Fast we have directly&nbsp;
<br>supported the partnership of the Ottawa-Carleton Y with the Togo YMCA.&nbsp;
<p>b) The newest project is the importation and sale of Fair Trade Sports
Balls partly to raise funds for
<br>peace building projects in war-torn countries but also to draw attention
to the potential of Fair Trade&nbsp;
<br>and the evil of child labour in industries such as hand stitched sports
balls. For the latest information&nbsp;
<br>visit <a href="http://www.ncf.ca/yfocus/fairtrade">www.ncf.ca/yfocus/fairtrade&nbsp;</a><a href="http://www.ncf.ca/yfocus/fairtrade"></a>
<p>b) Brother Clubs.
<br>Y FOCUS maintains links with several clubs around the world, exchanging
bulletins, letters and visits. Occasionally we will join together in development
projects and we have the distinction of having&nbsp;
<br>sponsored the first club in Sierra Leone, in Freetown. Other partner
clubs include Naperville, Illinois,
<br>Nairobi South, Kenya, Gdynia, Poland, Freetown ,Sierra Leone and St
Petersburg, Russia. Club&nbsp;
<br>members are invited to act as the club representative to one of our
Brother clubs.
<p>c) Youth Educational Exchange Program.
<br>Children of club members around the world can spend up to a year in
the home of a club member
<br>in another country. Over the years we have hosted 16 young people from
Norway, Denmark,&nbsp;
<br>Sweden, Finland and Kenya. At the same time we have sent young people
to Denmark, Norway,&nbsp;
<br>Sweden, India, Australia and New Zealand. More emphasis is now being
placed on the short term
<br>program due to difficulties in placing students in schools.
<p>d) Short Term Exchange Program (STEP)
<br>This is an international exchange program where young people ages 14
- 25 years, from Y Service
<br>clubs or from the Y can spend up to 12 weeks with a family in another
country. Up to now we have
<br>hosted&nbsp; STEP students from Finland, Malaysia, Japan, Taiwan and
Russia.
<p>e) Brotherhood Fund
<br>Club members are eligible to apply for grants to travel to conventions
or to visit other clubs in other&nbsp;
<br>countries. Most years we host an international visitor travelling as
a Brotherhood delegate. Club&nbsp;
<br>members host these international visitors in their homes and we usually
have a special meeting so that
<br>all the club can meet the delegate. We raise money through personal
donations at meetings and&nbsp;
<br>through the sale of used stamps we collect. Each club must contribute
a minimum of $5 per member,&nbsp;
<br>per year, to have members eligible for grants.
<p>f) Alexander Scholarship fund
<br>Y Service Clubs in Canada provide annually, about 10 scholarships of
at least $500 to YMCA&nbsp;
<br>Canada for young people and Y staff for university training or upgrading
courses. We collect funds&nbsp;
<br>through a Booster Prize raffle at the dinner meetings and through personal
donations.
<p>g) Canadian Friends of Sierra Leone
<br>After the end of the civil war in Sierra Leone in 2000, there is now
a fragile peace that will need
<br>years of support. Through various programs we try to raise&nbsp; much
needed funds for the work of&nbsp;
<br>indigenous Sierra Leone NGO's in their peace building work. To facilitate
this work the club&nbsp;
<br>founded a network called the <a href="http://www.ncf.ca/yfocus/sierraleone" target="_top">Canadian
Friends of Sierra Leone,</a> working with the Sierra Leone&nbsp;
<br>Descendants Union, interested churches and individuals.
<p>g) George Jackson Youth Leadership Development Fund
<br>We work mainly through the Y in Ottawa and set up in the Y the George
Jackson Fund initially
<br>to assist international students who are studying in Ottawa, especially
those at Carleton University.&nbsp;
<br>The fund is a place of last resort when all other sources have been
exhausted. Funds are also&nbsp;
<br>available to young Canadians to further their experience in and understanding
of international issues.&nbsp;</td>
