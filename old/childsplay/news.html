<p>For 2007, we are happy to report that there has been increased interest
in taking used balls and purchasing new Fair Trade soccer balls for children
around the world.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>In 2006 we reported on some of the activities and donations we received.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><font size=+2>&nbsp; </font>PLAY FAIR 2006 was&nbsp; Ottawa's 3rd
Annual Fair Trade No Sweat Soccer Tournament, held June 18th, 2006 at Brewer
Park.&nbsp;</b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each team represented a country and each country
had a project related to children and youth (a school, orphanage, training
program, AIDS&nbsp; help). Teams were asked to gather contributions for
that project, either sports equipment (esp soccer balls) or school supplies
or cash donations.&nbsp;
<p>As a direct&nbsp; result of the tournament, we collected about 40 pairs
of shoes, a dozen balls, lots of uniforms, shin pads and shorts and raised
about $700 in contributions.
<p>
<hr width="100%">
<br>The<b> Almonte and District Soccer Club</b> provided one dozen teams
worth of jerseys (15 apiece).&nbsp;
<br>and&nbsp; included a&nbsp; new ball&nbsp; with each team kit.&nbsp;
<p>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<br><b>Elgin Sports</b> in Ottawa&nbsp; donated 1150 pairs of soccer shoes
to be provided to children in need. Y FOCUS will distribute the smaller
sizes to youth agencies such as the Boys and Girls Club and Brittania Woods
Community House. The larger sizes have been sent to schools and leagues
where we have agencies to distribute the shoes. For example we sent 115
pairs&nbsp; to Haiti for the use of 5 adult teams and new balls and jerseys
went later.
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<br>The <b>Ottawa Royals Soccer Club</b> collected over 150 used balls&nbsp;
at their annual Fun Day on August 26th.&nbsp;
<br><b>Nepean City Soccer Club</b> donated a further 40 used balls.&nbsp;
<br>
<hr width="100%" size="2">
<br>There was&nbsp; a wedding in August where the newly-weds asked their
guests to make a contribution to "Let The Children Play" in lieu of bringing
wedding gifts. $150 was raised.
<p>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Orin had a birthday in the Spring, he asked
his friends to bring no gifts but to contribute money to buy some soccer
balls for children abroad.&nbsp; We received $70 as a result and the funds
sent new soccer balls to a remote region of Cameroun. Check <a href="../../C:/WS_FTP/childsplay/news.html#Montreal">below</a>
for the request that we were able to fill due to Orin's gift.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><font size=-1>A request from Montreal in April
2006</font></b>
<p><font size=-1>My name is Tamara&nbsp; and last year I went to Cameroon,
Africa, to volunteer with a chimpanzee sanctuary located in the eastern
province. There are no NGOs catering to people in this region&nbsp; because
there is a low population rate, approximately 5 inhabitants per square
kilometer. This however does not mean that the people that live there are
not in need of help. While I was there, I visited many of the local villages
and schools. Villages in this area consist of approximately 10 houses made
out of mud bricks. It is a very poor region, however, the spirit of these
villagers is truly incredible, they make the most of what they have, even
though its very little. One of the things they enjoy the most is playing
'football',&nbsp; known to us as soccer. Their passion for the game is
overwhelming. I will be returning to Cameroon in July and Swiss Air has
generously donated shipping costs for eduational items, I couldn't think
of a better educational item to bring with me then soccer balls. I would
like to request that you donate some soccer balls to the kids in the eastern
province of Cameroon. I will supply photos of the kids&nbsp; with the balls
upon my return.</font>

<p>A village in Cameroun.&nbsp;
<p>Tamara picked up her box of balls in July and has sent lots of photos..
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Y Service clubs in the Mariti raised enough money to send 100 new soccer
balls to send to the Thika YMCA and other Y's&nbsp; in Kenya.&nbsp; I visited
the Thika Y when I was there earlier in the month and the soccer balls&nbsp;
the kids were using are deplorable.&nbsp; The group I was with have decided
to take up a collection to send the&nbsp; balls and we challenged the Y
Service clubs in the Maritimes to participate..&nbsp;
