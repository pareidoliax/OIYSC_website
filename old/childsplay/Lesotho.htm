</B><FONT SIZE=2><P>Help Lesotho is a Canadian initiative partnering public, private and volunteer resources, as a response to the increasingly alarming effects of poverty and HIV/AIDS in Lesotho, Southern Africa. </P>
<P>Project Help Lesotho was created in 2004 by an Ottawa resident, Dr. Peg Herbert.  Peg was inspired by a friend of hers from Lesotho who was studying at Ottawa University.  Lesotho is a small, land locked country that is completely surrounded by South Africa.  The people are very poor and the country is being devastated by the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  Project Help Lesotho has spear headed many programs to help the Basotho children in the following ways:  the building and supporting of boarding schools for young orphan girls, the twinning of Canadian and Besotho schools to promote friendship, give financial support to the schools in Lesotho and to help purchase school uniforms for the children.  There are also some economic projects that support local women making bead broaches, canvas bags and hats.  There have been leadership camps for the Besotho school children as well as leadership awards given to worthy recipients.  Canadians are given the opportunity to sponsor orphans, ensuring they have a school uniform and that their fees are paid so they can attend school.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There are now over 6,000 Basotho (the name of the people of Lesotho) children benefiting from our projects. There are thousands of Canadian students writing to their pen pals in English, their second language. In Canada, hundreds are involved in various ways. Funds are raised by children for children. Schools, churches, and individuals have come forward with real compassion to form relationships with our Basotho friends. Many have volunteered to work in Lesotho on specific projects for 1-6 months. In Lesotho, there are over 20 projects underway, with more in the final planning stages. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">             One of the poorest countries in the world, Lesotho has the 3rd highest rate of HIV/AIDS on earth. Over 30% of children are orphaned and life expectancy is rapidly falling to 31 years. Over 60% of the population is under 24 years of age. With a rapidly decreasing population of 2.1 million and a landmass of 30,500 sq. km, it is an unusually homogeneous population of 99.7% Basotho people, of whom 80% are Christian. It therefore does not have the racial and ethnic conflicts that draw media attention. <BR>
Called Roof of Africa by virtue of being the third highest country in the world, Lesotho is a small, mountainous and deforested country, with almost no natural resources. Well into its 5th year of debilitating drought, there is also a crucial water and food shortage. Soil erosion is expected to deplete arable land by 2040. An unemployment rate reaching 50-60% and an alarming degree of crime and stock theft are producing an unprecedented state of poverty. </P>

<B><P>The Flag.</P>
</B><P>Following a military coup which deposed the ruling Basotho National Party (BNP) government which had led the country since independence, a new flag was adopted in January 1987. It is believed that the old flag was scrapped because it was identified too closely with the BNP and incorporated its colours of red, white, blue and green. The shield and spears signify the importance of defence. <BR>
