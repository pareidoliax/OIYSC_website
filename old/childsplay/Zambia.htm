<P>The Kalingalinga Orphanage feeds 500 kids daily many positive for AIDS and  is run by Bishop Anderson. The Kanyama Community School, a non-government school, has over 300 students with 5 non-paid teachers and about 30% of the children are infected. Most are single and double-orphans (1 or both parents died). </P>
<P>There is also a Training Centre in Livingstone directed by  Fr. Katete Jackson Jones who wrote, </P>
<P>&quot;We are now partnering with ILO in withdrawing and preventing children from involvement in child labour in Livingstone. They are targeting 400 children to benefit. 200 will be taken out of child labour while 200 will be prevented from going into child labour. Of the 200 to be withdrawn, 100 will be trained at our Centre for survival skills such as Carpentry, Tailoring , Tie &amp; Dye and hair dressing.</P>
<P>Most of these children are exploited in such things as prostitution (Sex workers), crushing stones, selling different things in the streets, domestic works (servants or baby sitters), charcoal burning, etc. They go into all jobs so that they pay for schooling and to buy food because their parents have died and the guardian cannot afford to provide everything they may need. Sometimes it is the guardian or single parent that would send them to work to make ends meet.</P>
<P>&#9;At our training centre we have a limited capacity to accommodate the many children who may need these skills. We have negotiated with government that the children we shall be sponsoring should be exempted from school fees as a contribution from government. We believe that in this way, we shall put to an end to the vicious cycle of HIV/AIDS and poverty and the children shall be empowered with skills to survive and with formal education for their future.&quot;</P>

<P>The Zambian flag is exceptional in having its charges concentrated in its fly half". The red stands for the struggle for freedom, the black for the Zambian people, and the orange for natural resources and mineral wealth. The eagle is representative of the people's ability to rise above the nation's problems.</P>
