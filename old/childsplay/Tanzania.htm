</B><P>CSRAI supports an AIDS orphanage  run by the local NGO, MKUKI, in Tanzania. Since the early '90's MKUKI has been providing services and support to those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS in a rural area of Tanzania in the Kilimanjaro Region. MKUKI has provided many programs for orphans, who have lost parents to HIV/AIDS. MKUKI works closely with the schools in their area where principals and teachers identify the orphans in most critical need. Most recently they have started a school lunch program that provides a nutritious noon meal for the orphans at these schools.  Soccer balls have been given to Mkyashi Primary School and Kilema Primary School. The combined enrolment at these schools is over 2,000. </P>
<P>&quot;Through this network of schools  Mkuki, was able to distribute the soccer balls you donated. This is a huge gift for these children who already have suffered so much in their young lives. This will bring endless enjoyment to so many children who rarely, if ever, see or use a new soccer ball - but love the game of soccer!!  Many thanks, from CSRAI, MKUKI and all the students who are benefiting from your donation, warm regards,"   Bonnie Gray, President, </P>

<P>On 26 April 1964, </FONT><A HREF="tz-tng.html"><FONT SIZE=2>Tanganyika</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT><A HREF="tz-zan.html"><FONT SIZE=2>Zanzibar</FONT></A><FONT SIZE=2> merged to form a new republic, the name "Tanzania" being adopted on 29 October 1964. Like the name of the country, the new flag was a merger of that of its constituent parts. The lower green stripe of the former Tanganyika flag took the blue of the Zanzibari flag, and the stripes were re-arranged diagonally to give them equal status. <BR>
