</FONT><B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Kick off your new outdoor soccer season and </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">celebrate the 2006 FIFA World Cup of Soccer. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We have added an international twist to this years event by having each team represent a country, our own version of the World Cup.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">We plan to raise funds and collect sports and school supplies for development projects run by our participating agencies in the countries represented on the field.  </P>

<P>Choose a country to represent, from our list or from your own  contacts!&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>Design a  uniform carrying that country’s colours!</P>
<P>&#9;Gather contributions for a youth project in that country!</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Every team will choose a country to represent and be eligible for an award for wearing its colours in some creative way. In each country we will highlight a particular youth project that we would like you to support by collecting used soccer balls and other equipment as well as school supplies and cash donations. We will have a list  of countries to choose from or you can choose your own, perhaps supported by your local community group.  The preferred projects will be ones supported by small Canadian aid organizations, usually Ottawa based, that really need your help to carry out their projects. There will be some great prizes for the teams and individuals who contribute and we’ll make sure you know exactly where your contributions will be used. </P>
<P>Teams that register early will get the first choice of a country. Players who collect donations over $200 in value or over $500 in value will be eligible for special draws with some great prizes. There will be special recognition for the top contributing teams.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>Registration and tournament  information.</P>

</B><P>There are only 12 spots available and will be assigned on a first come – first served basis. Teams should register their intention to participate before February 28<SUP>th</SUP>. In March we will send out further information about the activities for the tournament. Once the 12 spots are filled we will create a waiting list. </P>
<P>&#9;Teams are co-ed and each team, must field at least 5 men and 5 women on the field at any one time. We guarantee at least three games in a round robin format where the top four teams will advance to the play-offs.</P>
<P>&#9;Awards will be given to selected players for hard work, sportsmanlike conduct and fair play and there will be awards for the members of the teams in the finals.</P>
<P>&#9;Registration fee is $15 per person with a minimum team registration of $225. More players may be added, allowing for 20 players per team, at $15 each. The registration fee includes water and fruit, a t-shirt  for each player, and Fair Trade game ball for the team.</P>

<B><P>What kind of donations are we looking for?</P>
<P>&#9;&#9;</P>
<P>&#9;</B>This tournament will be just one of a number of events being held across Canada under the title &quot;Let the Children Play&quot;. The goal is to collect used soccer balls and other sports equipment and make them available to any group which has a youth centred development project in a poor or war-affected country. Since November 2004, YSC Fair Trade Sports has sent almost 700 new and used soccer balls to orphanages, schools, refugee camps and YMCAs in 16 countries. Normally these are shipped using volunteers with the organizations funding these projects. This year we are partnering with  AirServ Canada to ship new Fair Trade soccer balls from our manufacturer in Pakistan directly to the projects  almost anywhere in the world. Cash donations will cover the cost of buying the balls and help with the shipping if needed.</P>

<P>&#9;To calculate the value of the donations for reporting and for awarding prizes, we have set  a dollar equivalent for all items collected and for this tournament, we suggest the teams collect the following:</P>

<P>&#9;&#9;<U>Items&#9;</U>&#9;&#9;&#9;<U>Cash equivalent</U>.</P>
<P>&#9;Used soccer balls&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;$5.00</P>
<P>&#9;Uniforms&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;$2.00</P>
<P>&#9;Soccer cleats and socks&#9;&#9;&#9;$5.00</P>
<P>&#9;School supply kit&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;$5.00</P>
<P>&#9;(pencils, crayons, notebook, eraser, pencil case)</P>

<P>Pledge sheets and donation record sheets will be provided when registrations are confirmed, in March.</P>
