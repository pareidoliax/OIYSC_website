<P ALIGN="CENTER">Helping children enjoy just being children, having fun, playing soccer or going to school, despite poverty, AIDS, hunger and family displacement.</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">All funds raised will go to schools, YMCAs, orphanages and refugee camps, wherever children need some joy and hope in their lives. You can also send new Fair Trade soccer balls and help end the exploitation of children as workers, so that they too can play. </P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">The soccer balls and other equipment collected will be given to your chosen  international project, involving children in poor and war affected countries.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">A new or used soccer ball will be an amazing gift to children who may never have seen a real soccer ball but play with leaves or plastic bags tied up with string. </P>
