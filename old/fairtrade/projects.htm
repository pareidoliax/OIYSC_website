              over the world there are kids, mad about soccer, who have to make 
              do with soccer balls made of rags, leaves or paper, tied up with 
              string. Now you can clean out and recycle all those soccer balls 
              that your children have outgrown and put them in the hands of kids 
              that will really appreciate them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>All 
              year, Y FOCUS Fair World Sports is accepting donations of used soccer 
              equipment to their &quot;<a href="http://www.ncf.ca/yfocus/childsplay">Let 
              the Children Play</a>&quot; program.</b> In Ottawa, we look for 
              schools, soccer leagues and churches to collect donations and use 
              local Fair Trade businesses and YMCA locations as drop-off points. 
              Y FOCUS members and friends then sort and package the balls, uniforms 
              and shoes for storage until they are shipped out via groups and 
              individuals who are going overseas and have some room in their baggage, 
              like Chris Seligy. </font></p>

              Nepal.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/nepal4.jpg" width="150" height="113" align="left" border="1">The 
              orphanage that I stayed at in Nepal was in Arubari, a small village 
              about 8km outside of Kathmandu. The orphanage is run by Nepali staff 
              and volunteers from all over the world and is under the general 
              directorship of Childhaven International, a Canadian organization 
              (see <a href="http://www.childhaven.ca">www.childhaven.ca</a> for 
              more information).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
              are over 100 boys and girls who live full-time at the orphanage 
              in Arubari. They range in nepal age from 1 year to 18 years although 
              the average age is probably about 8 years old. Not all of the children 
              are orphans but they are all children who were not consistently 
              receiving at least one meal a day before they were taken into the 
              home. At the home they receive 3 meals a day which consists of mostly 
              rice, curried potatoes, lentils and a few vegetables. They also 
              have a machine that produces soy milk from soy beans and each child 
              gets a glass of soy milk twice a day. The home is a modern design 
              and equipped with electric lights, plumbing and a solar hot water 
              heater but a low water table has left the well dry so water must 
              be trucked in a few times a week. The children sleep on the floor, 
              about 10 to a room that is roughly the size of an average North 
              American bedroom.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><img src="images/nepal2.jpg" width="150" height="113" align="right" border="1">In 
              spite of the somewhat crude living conditions, the children are 
              quite playful and affectionate and seem genuinely happy. They attend 
              school in a nearby village and are taught in English so they are 
              able to communicate quite well with English-speaking volunteers. 
              They have few chores to do at the home so when they are not at school 
              or doing their homework, they tend to spend most of their time playing 
              various games in and around the home. They are quite fond of football 
              (soccer) in particular but at the time of my arrival, they did not 
              have a soccer ball to play with. When they heard that I had brought 
              some soccer balls with me, I was immediately whisked away to a nearby 
              &quot;pitch&quot; to play with them. <img src="images/nepal1.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="left" border="1">Their 
              playing field was a very uneven and odd shaped surface perched on 
              top of a ridge, surrounded by terraced rice gardens, and there were 
              frequent jaunts down the hillside to retrieve wayward passes. Both 
              girls and boys participated in the games although it tended to be 
              the boys who participated more frequently.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">When 
              not being used on the soccer pitch, the soccer balls were used for 
              other games such as basketball and volleyball. The most remarkable 
              thing was that in spite of the fact that the balls were in high 
              demand and in constant use, the children insisted that I not give 
              them more than one (of the six that I brought) at a time. They wanted 
              to use one ball until it was no longer usable and only then be given 
              another one.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">All 
              in all, it was a very fulfilling experience and one that will not 
              soon be forgotten. Your gracious donation was certainly much appreciated 
              by all of the children at the home. It's truly amazing how much 
              of a difference a simple thing like a soccer ball can make to a 
              group of children who have so few material possessions. </font></p>
