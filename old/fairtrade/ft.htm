            TRADE </font> </b></font> 
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>Introduction</b><br>
              The following information includes a summary of what Amnesty International 
              says about Fair Trade sports ball production, especially soccer 
              balls. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              link between Fair Trade and soccer balls is child labour. According 
              to recent reports, thousands of children in India and Pakistan are 
              involved in the production of soccer balls. Workers in both countries 
              are earning wages much lower than the legal minimum and basic human 
              rights are routinely neglected. Another 250 million children around 
              the world and many of their families share the life of exploitation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>&quot;I 
              have been stitching balls for as long as I can remember,&quot; confided 
              Greeta, a young girl from Jalandhar, who estimated her age to be 
              between 10 and 12 years old. &quot;My hands are constantly in pain. 
              It feels like they are burning. There is nothing I can do. I have 
              to help my older sister complete the order.&quot;</i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Most 
              children are forced into labour to help their families survive. 
              Ball stitching becomes home based family work where a middle man, 
              acting on behalf of a sporting goods manufacturer, provides the 
              ball pieces for in-home production. While helping their parents, 
              many of the children miss out on their education, creating a vicious 
              cycle of poverty and uneducated labour.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
              average daily earning of an adult male in ball stitching is around 
              20 rupees, about one-third of the Indian minimum wage of 63 rupees. 
              The wages of children are even lower. When we talk about child labour, 
              we are referring to something intolerable. Children are denied the 
              right to be children and denied basic rights of education, recreation 
              and health. The International Labour Organization estimates there 
              are more than 15 000 children stitching soccer balls in Pakistan. 
              With the negative publicity, it is now suspected that some of the 
              industry has moved to China and elsewhere in Asia and Latin America.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>What's 
              fair about Fair Trade?</b><br>
              Products that carry a Fair Trade label have been certified that 
              their manufacturing process meets certain social, economic and environmental 
              standards. Our sports balls carry the Transfair Canada label which 
              means that companies like Talon has agreed to meet the expectations 
              of the Fair Trade Labeling Organization (FLO) and to co-operate 
              fully with their monitoring teams when they visit. The manufacturer's 
              price includes a &quot;fair-trade premium&quot;, about 20% which 
              is to be used for improvement of the socio-economic situation of 
              the workers, their families and communities. Workers and management 
              decide jointly on the use of the premium such as providing an after-school 
              program or a community clinic.. The employer must have the commitment 
              and capacity to administer the fair trade premium in a way that 
              is transparent and democratic for workers and the FLO.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>A 
              Fair Living Wage</b><br>
              Under the Fair Trade scheme the calculation is that a family should 
              have 6,000 Pakistani rupees per month to cover all basic needs and 
              have some 'money on the side'. Fair stitching wages are calculated 
              to provide - if Fair Trade orders are there all the time - individual 
              incomes of more than Rs. 3.000/month (i.e. two earners are needed 
              per family to reach the Fair Trade minimum). It is not enough to 
              simply bar children from working; the fair living wage ensures that 
              the children have enough family support to succeed at school. Nevertheless, 
              children under 15 are not employed, and the labour of children between 
              15 and 18 must not interfere with education.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The 
              Making of Soccer Balls</b><br>
              FIFA standard balls are hand-stitched. In a size 5 ball, there are 
              690 stitches. As each of the five-sided pieces of polyurethane artificial 
              leather are stitched to the others, the ball's sphere gradually 
              closes. So, the last number of stitches are done &quot;blind&quot;. 
              That is, they use a pair of long needle-pullers, threading between 
              stitches that they have already made, because they cannot get their 
              hands inside the ball. At the same time, they have to be careful 
              that they do not puncture the butyl air bladder inside. For the 
              higher-quality balls, each stitch has to be pulled and tied at a 
              tension of 40 kilograms. Only a human being can do all this! Eighty 
              percent of the world's stitched soccer balls are made in the Sialkot 
              region of Pakistan, where our supplier, Talon Sports, is located.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Over 
              50 international soccer ball brands rely on Sialkot to meet their 
              customer demand and in 1997, the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce entered 
              into an agreement with the International Labour Organization and 
              UNICEF for the elimination of child labour from the soccer ball 
              industry. The agreement is known as the Atlanta Agreement. With 
              ILO monitoring, the various initiatives to eliminate child labour 
              are showing results in lower school dropout rates and increased 
              school enrolment.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In 
              1998, FIFA, the governing body for international soccer, established 
              a code of conduct to prohibit the use of child labour and to require 
              decent working conditions for adult workers. However available evidence 
              points to routine violations of the code by manufacturers.</font></p>
