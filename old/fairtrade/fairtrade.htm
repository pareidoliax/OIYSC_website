Introduction</b></font>                      <br>
                     The following information includes a summary of what
Amnesty                      International says about Fair Trade sports ball
production,                      especially soccer balls. You can visit their
web site at <a href="http://store.amnesty.ie/home/footballs"

 size="2">The                      link between Fair Trade and soccer balls
is child labour.                      According to recent reports, thousands
of children in India                      and Pakistan are involved in the
production of soccer balls.                      Workers in both countries
are earning wages much lower than                      the legal minimum
and basic human rights are routinely neglected.                      Another
250 million children around the world and many of                      their
families share the life of exploitation.</font></p>
                   
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size="2">                      <i>"I have been stitching balls for as long
as I can                      remember," confided Greeta, a young girl from
Jalandhar,                      who estimated her age to be between 10 and
12 years old. "My                      hands are constantly in pain. It feels
like they are burning.                      There is nothing I can do. I
have to help my older sister                      complete the order."</i></font></p>
                   
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size="2">Most                      children are forced into labour to help
their families survive.                      Ball stitching becomes home
based family work where a middle                      man, acting on behalf
of a sporting goods manufacturer, provides                      the ball
pieces for in-home production. While helping their                      parents,
many of the children miss out on their education,                      creating
a vicious cycle of poverty and uneducated labour.<br>
                     <br>
                     The average daily earning of an adult male in ball stitching
                     is around 20 rupees, about one-third of the Indian minimum
                     wage of 63 rupees. The wages of children are even lower.
When                      we talk about child labour, we are referring to
something                      intolerable. Children are denied the right
to be children                      and denied basic rights of education,
recreation and health.                      The International Labour Organization
estimates there are                      more than 15 000 children stitching
soccer balls in Pakistan.                      With the negative publicity,
it is now suspected that some                      of the industry has moved
to China and elsewhere in Asia and                      Latin America.</font></p>

 size="2"><b><font color="#990000"><a name="fair"></a>What's            
         fair about Fair Trade?</font></b><br>
                     Products that carry a Fair Trade label have been certified
                     that their manufacturing process meets certain social,
economic                      and environmental standards. Our sports balls
carry the Transfair                      Canada label which means that companies
like Talon has agreed                      to meet the expectations of the
Fair Trade Labeling Organization                      (FLO) and to co-operate
fully with their monitoring teams                      when they visit. The
manufacturer's price includes a "fair-trade                      premium",
about 20% which is to be used for improvement                      of the
socio-economic situation of the workers, their families                 
    and communities. Workers and management decide jointly on           
          the use of the premium such as providing an after-school program
                     or a community clinic.. The employer must have the commitment
                     and capacity to administer the fair trade premium in
a way                      that is transparent and democratic for workers
and the FLO.</font></p>
                   
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size="2"><b><font color="#990000"><a name="wage"></a>A                 
    Fair Living Wage</font></b><br>
                     Under the Fair Trade scheme the calculation is that
a family                      should have 6,000 Pakistani rupees per month
to cover all                      basic needs and have some 'money on the
side'. Fair stitching                      wages are calculated to provide
- if Fair Trade orders are                      there all the time - individual
incomes of more than Rs. 3.000/month                      (i.e. two earners
are needed per family to reach the Fair                      Trade minimum).
It is not enough to simply bar children from                      working;
the fair living wage ensures that the children have                     
enough family support to succeed at school. Nevertheless,               
      children under 15 are not employed, and the labour of children    
                 between 15 and 18 must not interfere with education.<br>

                     <font color="#990000"><b><a name="making"></a>The Making
of                      Soccer Balls</b></font><br>
                     FIFA standard balls are hand-stitched. In a size 5 ball,
there                      are 690 stitches. As each of the five-sided pieces
of polyurethane                      artificial leather are stitched to the
others, the ball's                      sphere gradually closes. So, the
last number of stitches are                      done "blind". That is, they
use a pair of long needle-pullers,                      threading between
stitches that they have already made, because                      they cannot
get their hands inside the ball. At the same time,                      they
have to be careful that they do not puncture the butyl                  
   air bladder inside. For the higher-quality balls, each stitch        
             has to be pulled and tied at a tension of 40 kilograms. Only
                     a human being can do all this! Eighty percent of the
world's                      stitched soccer balls are made in the Sialkot
region of Pakistan,                      where our supplier, Talon Sports,
is located.</font></p>
                   
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size="2">Over                      50 international soccer ball brands rely
on Sialkot to meet                      their customer demand and in 1997,
the Sialkot Chamber of                      Commerce entered into an agreement
with the International                      Labour Organization and UNICEF
for the elimination of child                      labour from the soccer
ball industry. The agreement is known                      as the Atlanta
Agreement. With ILO monitoring, the various                      initiatives
to eliminate child labour are showing results                      in lower
school dropout rates and increased school enrolment.<br>
                     <br>
                     In 1998, FIFA, the governing body for international
soccer,                      established a code of conduct to prohibit the
use of child                      labour and to require decent working conditions
for adult                      workers. However available evidence points
to routine violations                      of the code by manufacturers.</font></p>
