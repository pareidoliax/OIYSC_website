   <td valign="Top" colspan="3">Y FOCUS has established a certain number
of  annual projects that we can manage but we are always looking for new
ideas  and are open to assisting other organizations in their fund raising
rather  than create our own.&nbsp;        
      <p>a) Christmas Trees&nbsp; <br>
 This is our largest project using the front of the Metro Y as our sales
area. In 1992 we opened a second lot at the Carlingwood Y on Lockhart Ave
to support the Britannia Community&nbsp; House in the west end of Ottawa.
Normally we raise between $5000 and $6000 annually. Every club member is
asked to take three two hour shifts and help with the set-up and cleanup.
We continue to build a list of helpers from among our families and friends.&nbsp;
      </p>
       
      <p>b) Sales&nbsp; <br>
 We use the Y lobby for sales at Christmas and Easter, especially for plants. 
Sometimes there are garage sales or sales of items such as chocolates. In 
2006 we&nbsp; opened a Fair&nbsp; Trade Boutique called the Fair World Y Boutique,
to promote Fair Trade and raise funds for the Y's&nbsp; Community  Fund.
We try to staff the boutique with volunteers&nbsp; during the mornings,  from
9 a.m. - 1&nbsp; p.m. For information about our products click <a href="FairWorld">
 here.</a>
  </p>
       
      <p>c) Time of Fast&nbsp; <br>
 During February, all Y Service clubs around the world are asked to support 
development projects of the World Alliance of YMCAs by giving up one or more 
meals and contributing the money saved. Some of our members fast for 24 hours 
and get sponsors allowing us to raise from $1000 - $2000 annually.&nbsp;
      </p>
       
      <p>d) Supporting our Community Partners&nbsp; <br>
 We try to support those groups with whom we work in the community, especially 
the National Capital Region&nbsp; YMCA-YWCA and the Canadian Friends of Sierra 
Leone, plus Gracefield Conference and Camping Centre, and others.&nbsp; </p>
       
      <p>e) International Funds of Y Service Clubs.&nbsp; <br>
 We raise funds for several Y Service Club programs by personal contributions
 and small fund raising events at meetings. We hold draws for the Alexander
 Scholarship Fund to support Y staff training We collect loose change and
stamps for the Brotherhood Fund to help club members and Y staff travel to
other clubs and conventions. We accept contributions for the Endowment Fund
in honour of deceased&nbsp; or long-time members. Each year we also allocate 
funds for work with young people and exchange students within the Central 
Canada Region.&nbsp; </p>
       
      <p>f) Fair Trade Certified Sports Balls&nbsp; <br>
 This project began in 2003 as a way to support our work in Sierra Leone
and other war-torn countries where sports and education play an important
role in building peace. The project is now a national&nbsp; project of Y
Service Clubs and the Ottawa club co-ordinates a Canada-wide network of clubs,
Fair Trade&nbsp; groups and churches to sell Fair Trade sports balls. Visit&nbsp;
